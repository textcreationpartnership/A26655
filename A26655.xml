            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Lord, this enſuing Treatiſe comes to Salute the World, and appear upon the publick Stage under the Honorable Shade and Patrociny of your name, not preſuming to add any Luſtre thereunto, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it is uncapable, and whereof your Lordſhips Prudence and Vertues have been ſuch publick Heraulds to the World, that I ſhall rather im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a Ceſſation to my Pen, and enjoyn my ſelf a neceſſary ſilence, as my higheſt <hi>Encomium,</hi> than be Guilty, with <hi>Apelles</hi> in forming of the Image, of interweaving the conſtrained Fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeurs of my beſt Rhetorick with your Lordſhips deſerved Commendation.</p>
            <p>But knowing the hazard of theſe publick Scenes, and the Worlds view, where there is always a <hi>Momus</hi> ready to carp, it comes to ſeek
<pb facs="tcp:56523:3"/>ſhelter under your Lordſhips favorable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, whereunto it is alſo encouraged with good hopes of obtaining the cheerful Countenance of your Authority, becauſe of your Pious and Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Zeal againſt all the enemies of our Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Faith, and the Divine Truth; eſpecially theſe pernicious and (beyond all Heathens) moſt inhumane Proto-plaſta's of <hi>Quakeriſm</hi> (I mean the <hi>Jeſuits</hi>) unto whom the latter Profeſſion owes the Founding of their Order, and a great many of their Principles, be they never ſo ſhie and nice to Confeſs it.</p>
            <p>It doth alſo with Modeſt humility lay claim to one intereſt into your Lordſhips Tutelage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, albeit it was elſewhere conceived, and had the form of one <hi>Embryo,</hi> yet it hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived its juſt meaſures for a regular Birth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the precinct of your Honorable Juriſdiction, and though of <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Parentage, yet it is truly <hi>London</hi> Born.</p>
            <p>I know very well there are many in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining Age of Chriſtianity, who account all Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations about Principles of Religion, how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary ſoever, providing men live well, to be but vain Jangling (wherein they exactly Homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logate the <hi>Quakers</hi> (as I well know) but their proviſion, though it were granted to be enough (which it is not) is impoſſible, if people be
<pb facs="tcp:56523:3"/>miſled in neceſſary Principles; ſeeing no man can live well who miſtakes his Rode-way; and follows wrong directions and lies) and therefore as we are very heartily willing to Diſcharge all Debates a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Opinions which yield no fruit to Edification, and make us no ſounder Chriſtians; ſo their great care is to have all the other Caſhiered alſo.</p>
            <p>But when the moſt neceſſary Truths are bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly invaded, and our common Faith in danger to be ſupplanted, it looks not like Chriſtian Courage, or Zeal, but is rather a plain betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Truth, for us to hold our peace, and ſuffer the enemy how contemptible ſoever they may ſeem, by their real Triumphs, though but counterfeited Trophees of a pretended Victory, erected meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon our Cowardiſe and Sloth, not the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of our Cauſe, or their Strength, to gather Proſelytes, and increaſe their numbers. This is not to be valiant for the Truth upon the Earth. Chriſt did not ſo let the <hi>Sadduces</hi> (a contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and fooliſh people) paſs without a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrative Confutation. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo fought with Beaſts at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and his Epiſtles declare what care he took, at the Spirits direction too, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dargue the Errors of his time.</p>
            <p>This Tractate ſhall not much value the obloquy and Sarcaſms of theſe men, nor of any other whom nothing can pleaſe, which is not either the fruit of
<pb facs="tcp:56523:4"/>their proper Invention, or elſe, at leaſt, adequately adjuſted to their prejudicate apprehenſions, and foreconceived Opinions; if it be but (which is its great ambition) acceptable to your Lordſhip, and Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying to ſuch as deſire to know and love the Truth.</p>
            <p>And though, reflecting upon the Brutiſh abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of the party againſt whom I have Embarqu'd in this Province, not only renouncing all true Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Religion, but alſo ſtifling their very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of reaſon, my adopting of this piece ſo high may almoſt ſeem unſutable, yet when I contemplate the great Worth and Excellency of the Subject, Matter, and Theme I am to treat upon, being no leſs then the whole Divine Ordinances of the Goſpel, and the moſt precious, and many of them moſt neceſſary Truths of Jeſus, I hope my Nuncu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation ſhall no ways be thought incongruous, if I have but been ſo happy, as rightly to encounter the Adverſaries, and dextrouſly to vindicate and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play the Standard of the Sacred Truth, which with what force and evidence I have done I ſubmit to your Lordſhips <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mpirage and Judgment, whom that God may bleſs, and make proſperous here, and eternally happy hereafter, is the earneſt Prayer of your Lordſhips moſt Obedient Servant,</p>

            <p>In this enſuing Treatiſe I have endeavoured as much Brevity as may conſiſt with Perſpicuity, having no where ſtood on inlarging Amplifications, except where the right handling of the purpoſe doth neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it; nor have I Cited any humane Teſtimonies againſt the Adverſaries, ſeeing theſe they do not value, except when they think they make for them, eſpecially <hi>ad hominem,</hi> and therefore I would not have the work by the unprofitable acceſſion of theſe to ſwell; neither have I adduced any Argument lying far remote from the Principles, becauſe ſuch long Deductions are by the unlearned more hardly perceived: But after a brief ſtate of the Queſtion (which the diſingenuous <hi>Quakers</hi> almoſt every where pervert) I have delivered a few evident Arguments thereby irreſiſtibly eſtabliſhing our Doctrine, and overthrowing the contradictory Doctrine of the Adverſaries, and thereafter I propoſe, and anſwer their Objections, where (except in ſome few Queſtions that under the ſame dreſs have been handled formerly betwixt our Writers on the one part, and the <hi>Papiſts, Anabaptiſts, Arminians,</hi> &amp;c. on the other part, where the Objections are long ago abundantly anſwered by our Writers, though even in theſe alſo I propoſe and and anſwer ſome of the chiefeſt, together with theſe lately deviſed by the <hi>Quakers</hi>) I adduce and Anſwer all that (ſo far as I can learn) they have to ſay againſt us, or for themſelves, in defence of their Heretical Doctrine whereunto their following Queries relate, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed comprehend the very Cardinal hinges and eſſential
<pb facs="tcp:56523:6"/>Principles wherein the very Life and Soul of <hi>Quakeriſm</hi> conſiſts, and wherewith it ſtands and falls.</p>
            <p>The Scripture hath indeed fore-told us that in the latter days men <hi>ſhall bring in damnable Hereſies, even denying the Lord that bought them</hi> (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1.) and that they ſhall <hi>give heed to ſeducing Spirits, and Doctrines of Devils</hi> (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1.) and <hi>ſhall not endure ſound Doctrine, but after their own luſts heap up Teachers to themſelves, and turn away their ears from the Truth, and hearken unto Fables</hi> (2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3.4.) and <hi>that Hereſies muſt, be that theſe who are approved may be made manifeſt</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.19.) But as Chriſt ſays, <hi>that offences muſt come, but wo to that man by whom they come (Mat.</hi> 18.7.) So we may well ſay, that though Hereſies muſt be, yet wo, and a heavy wo, to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors thereof: for whatever Innocency ſome impious Fools Atheiſtically Sceptick in matters of Faith, and the Principles of Religion do aſcribe unto Hereſie, yet the Scripture doth far otherwiſe pronounce thereof, calling it a work of the fleſh (<hi>Galat.</hi> 5.20.) and a thing that <hi>overthroweth the Faith</hi> (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.18.) <hi>and a Doctrine of Devils</hi> (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1.) and knitting and connecting Damnation, ſwift Deſtruction, and the Lake of Fire and Brimſtone unto Hereticks, falſe Teachers, and falſe Prophets (2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.11, 12. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.20.) nor is there any Cenſure in Scripture more peremptory then that againſt Hereticks (<hi>Tit.</hi> 3.10.) and the Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of falſe Prophets and blind Guides are in the ſame danger with the Leaders (<hi>Jer.</hi> 14.15, 16. <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.4. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.11.12.) and ſurely <hi>Quakeriſm</hi> is one of the chiefeſt Hereſies and moſt damnable Deluſions that ever ſet foot in the Chriſtian world. For, beſide that by their rejecting of all manner of external Ordinances, their denying the Scriptures to be the Rule, and ſetting
<pb facs="tcp:56523:6"/>up the Light within for the Rule, they do directly ſtrike at the Foundation of all, with one Blow over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning (ſo far as they can) the whole Rule of Faith and Duty, and ſetting a New one of their own Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the room thereof; Beſide this (I ſay) this Hereſie is a very Sink, or an univerſal Syſtem of almoſt all the groſſe Errors which hitherto have annoyed the Church of God, as cannot be unknown to ſuch as know the Errors which heretofore have troubled the Church, and have occaſion of Converſe with the <hi>Quakers,</hi> or of reading their Books. And therefore people had need to beware of them (<hi>Mat.</hi> 7.15.) for their word eateth as doth a Canker. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.17.18.</p>
            <p>Yet we do not look upon all of the Profeſſion of Quaking in the ſame manner, or as Conſtituted in the ſame Category of Degrees: for we know that ſome of them are through ſimplicity and weakneſs ſeduced, who may as yet (peradventure) obtain repentance to the acknowledging of the Truth, and be recovered out of the ſnare of the Devil, whoſe Recovery, as it is one of the ſpecial deſigns of this ſmall Treatiſe, ſo we heartily pray God to make it ſucceſsful for that end. Others of them are wilful Seducers and malicious Oppoſers of the Truth, whoſe Blaſphemous Mouths muſt be ſtopt, and their Heretical fury repreſſed, that the Truth may not be Troden under foot, and the ſimple Seduced, who are eaſily enſnared where ſuch men get way, and are not Redargued.</p>
            <p>That which hath deceived and been a Snare unto many ſimple and ignorant people is ſome hairy Garments of a few (and but a few) external Duties of the ſecond Table of the Law wherewith theſe Inſtruments of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> have Clothed themſelves. But ſuch ſhould remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that falſe Apoſtles and Miniſters of <hi>Satan</hi> do
<pb facs="tcp:56523:7"/>Transform themſelves into the Apoſtles of Chriſt and Miniſters of Righteouſneſs, even as <hi>Satan</hi> alſo Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms himſelf into an Angel of light (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.13, 14, 15.) and falſe Prophets being inwardly Wolves do notwithſtanding come in Sheeps Clothing (<hi>Mat.</hi> 7.15.) and even Reſiſters of the Truth put on a form of Godlineſs (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5, 8.) and however theſe Doctors of the <hi>Quakers</hi> Mask and Vizorn themſelves with ſome few externals of the ſecond Table; yet how even in Doctrine they trample generally upon the whole Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law, but more eſpecially upon the firſt Table there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which yet in reaſon ought to have the firſt room, is not obſcure.</p>
            <p>For, as for the Firſt Commandment, it is notour to all acquaint with the Principles of the <hi>Quakers</hi> how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly even in Doctrine, they contradict and oppoſe the ſame, while they Impudently deny that any man who hath not received the Spirit ought to Worſhip God.</p>
            <p>This is ſo known a Tenet of the <hi>Quakers</hi> that we need hardly to produce Teſtimonies thereof, but it may be ſeen in a Book of theirs Publiſhed in the year 1668, entituled <hi>The Principles of Truth, or a Declaration of their Faith,</hi> in the 81, 82, and 92 pages whereof they expreſly Teach (and I ſhall repeat their very words) That all men ought <hi>Firſt</hi> to wait <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntil</hi> they receive the Spirit in Truth, <hi>Then</hi> in the ſame Truth to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God in Spirit, who is a Spirit. In plain Terms that is to ſay, men muſt firſt wait until they receive the Spirit before they offer to meddle in worſhipping of God. The ſame alſo may be ſeen in a moſt virulent Printed Pamphlet of theirs Intituled in the beginning of the Chapters or Sections thereof (for I had it without a Title page) <hi>The Principles of the Prieſt</hi> (ſo they
<pb facs="tcp:56523:7"/>call the Miniſters of <hi>Scotland</hi> of whom they there ſpeak) <hi>of ſuch a Place, and ſuch a Place,</hi> in the 14. and 15 pages whereof they directly Impugn and oppoſe this Poſition and Principle alledged by them to have been Taught by Mr. <hi>John Carſtairs</hi> Miniſter at <hi>Glaſgow, viz. That all men whatſoever ought to Worſhip God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Unto this their Atheiſtical Doctrine is Subalternate that other impious Principle of theirs, <hi>That no man ought to Pray to God till he be actually moved thereunto, and Influenced by the Spirit;</hi> otherwiſe Mr. <hi>George Keith</hi> one of their Chief Apoſtles affirms it is but Will-worſhip and Superſtition, in his <hi>Quakeriſm no Popery,</hi> page 99. and 100. Good Reader allow me to take a ſmall word of theſe Mad Principles, and I ſhall do it very briefly.</p>
            <p>Therefore firſt, all men whatſoever they be are bound to Fear, Reverence, Love, and praiſe God; ſay the Contrary who dare: but theſe are all moſt principal Arts or parts of the Worſhip of God: Therefore this Principle of the <hi>Quakers</hi> is both Falſe and Prophane.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Obedience to God Eſſentially and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſably includes worſhipping of God, ſeeing it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes a ſubjecting and ſtooping to his Yoke and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignity, and a doing of Homage and Honour unto him, and this alſo includes Reverence, all which are no mean parts of his moſt Subſtantial and Moral worſhip. Well then, if no man ought to Worſhip God until firſt he receive the Spirit, then no man ought to obey God until firſt he receive the Spirit, ſeeing obedience Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially includes Worſhip and cannot be performed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, as is ſhewed: but it is utterly Atheiſtical, Profane, and Abſurd to ſay, that no man ought to obey God until firſt he receive the Spirit: for then no unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed man ought to obey God, ſeeing ſuch men have not received the Spirit (<hi>Joh.</hi> 14.17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9.) if
<pb facs="tcp:56523:8"/>then unrenewed men ought not to obey God, then they are not under any Law of God, and he requires no obedience of them (for if they be under any Law of his, and if he requires any Duty of them, I am ſure, the <hi>Quakers</hi> will never get them exempted from it) Well then, if unrenewed men be not under any Command or Law of God, and he requires no Duty of them, then it follows Infallibly, firſt, that let unrenewed men do what they will they cannot ſin againſt God, ſeeing ſuch as are not under any Command or Law of God cannot traſgreſs any Law of his, and ſo ſin againſt him (ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.15. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.4.) Such men then (in the <hi>Quakers</hi> Principles) may deny, diſown, reject, hate, and Contemn God, Worſhip the Devil, and Debauch at their pleaſure; and yet they cannot ſin againſt God for all that, ſeeing they are not under any Law of God. Secondly, it follows thereupon that Reprobates are all moſt unjuſtly Condemned for their ſinning againſt God, ſeeing they (not having received the Spirit) are not under Law to God (as is ſuppoſed) and ſo cannot be Guilty of ſinning againſt him. Thirdly it follows there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon that unrenewed men cannot ſin albeit they ſhould never ſo much Counte-ract and Contraveen all the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the ſecond Table of the Law alſo, ſeeing theſe that Tranſgreſs no Law of God nor any Command of his cannot be ſinners, ſeeing <hi>Sin is a Tranſgreſſion of the Law,</hi> and where no Law is there is no Tranſgreſſion, they are not capable of Trangreſſng a Law who are not under it and bound to obey it. Hence then (in the <hi>Quakers</hi> Principles) unrenewed men may Lawfully Diſhonour, and Defame all men, Murder, commit Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Steal, bear falſe Witneſs, and what not?</p>
            <p>Is not that a ſweet Doctrine that tends ſo directly to all miſchief and wickedneſs, loſing all men that have
<pb facs="tcp:56523:8"/>not received the Spirit from all Bonds of God, and cutting aſunder all the Divine Cords of their Duty? are not the Sage Doctors of theſe black Myſteries of <hi>Satan</hi> very Divinely Inſpired? Do they not ſeem to be very Pious? Would it not be a ſweet world if theſe Principles were put in practiſe? God preſerve us from from ſo Impious a Piety, and ſuch ſtark Mad Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which (I am ſure) are the very quinteſſence of the Devils whole Treaſury, and the utmoſt of his ſtrength and endeavour.</p>
            <p>Hence falls that other Lewd and Prophane Principle of the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſubalternate to their Doctrine here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently Confuted, <hi>viz.</hi> That no man ought to Pray to God until he be actually moved and influenced there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by the Spirit, ſeeing calling upon God is a part of Moral Worſhip, or of our Obedience to the Moral Law, whereunto all men are obliged. <hi>Pour out thy wrath upon the Heathen that know thee not, and upon the Kingdoms that call not on thy name.</hi> Pſal. 79.6. Jer. 10.25.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Quakers</hi> have ſomewhat to ſay in defence of this their impious Doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> unrenewed men (ſay they) cannot but ſin in their Worſhip to God: <hi>Ergo</hi> they ought not to Worſhip him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> By this Quaking-Argument no man on Earth ſhould offer to Worſhip God, ſeeing there is ſomewhat of ſin cleaving to the beſt Actions of the Saints hereaway, being ſtill defective in the meaſure, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of goodneſs preſcribed by the Law, and coming from an heart that is not perfectly clean (<hi>Prov.</hi> 20.9.) but the Fleſh ſtill luſting againſt the Spirit, ſo that we cannot do the things that we would (<hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17.) much leſs can we reach the whole Dimenſions of our Duty. Again, even the Plowing, and ſo the Eating, Sleeping, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the wicked is ſin (<hi>Prov.</hi> 21.4.) ſhall the wicked
<pb facs="tcp:56523:9"/>then do nothing at all, becauſe whatever they do, they will go about in a ſinful manner? I think not. And hence we deny the Conſequence of their Argument.</p>
            <p>Secondly, no man indeed is obliged to ſin, but yet all men are obliged to worſhip God, which is another thing, and is (I am ſure) no thing, but a Duty; and that unrenewed men ſin in the manner of performance it is their own fault proceeding from the corruption of their hearts, which can never excuſe them from their Duty. Does mens Faults that they are Guilty of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve them from their Duty, and Diſcharge their obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to the Law? ſay it not for ſhame. And hence again we deny the Conſequence.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, the worſhip and obedience performed by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renewed men (ſuch as it is, or may be called: for it is not ſimply obedience, but it is only ſuch, and ſo called in reſpect of the matter and ſubſtance of the Act, which is according to the Law, though the Principles, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and End are not) is much better than a total re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the Commandment, ſeeing that is good in reſpect of the matter and ſubſtance of the Act which agrees with the Law, as for example, when an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed man gives a poor man an Alms, or does any other Action commanded by the Law: But the total rejection of the Commandment, is upon all accounts and every way evil. And hence again we defie the Conſequence. See this objection in the <hi>Quakers</hi> Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet fore-mentioned called the <hi>Prieſts Principles</hi> in the 14 and 15 pages thereof.</p>
            <p>Again they object, that no worſhip is acceptable to God but that which is in the Spirit; and that therefore no man ought to worſhip God that hath not received the Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Albeit no obedience or worſhip which unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
<pb facs="tcp:56523:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>men are in that ſtate able to perform, be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God, yet they are ſtill obliged to worſhip God, and that with an acceptable worſhip; nor does or can their Inability to perform acceptable worſhip; take away their obligation to perform it, ſeeing we did all once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ability in our common Parent and repreſentative head <hi>Adam,</hi> and the loſing of it is our fault whereof we are Guilty (<hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12.19.) and whereby we can never be excuſed from our Duty, or God and his Law loſe their Authority over us. And hence the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence periſhes. Secondly, we have ſhewed already that the worſhip and obedience of unrenewed men (ſuch as it is, as was explained) is better than their total diſobedience and utter rejection of the Commandment (its better to live Chaſte, though neither Principles, Manner, nor End be good, than to commit Adultery with our Neighbours Wife.) And hence again falls the Conſequence. See this Objection in their forementioned Book called, <hi>The Principles of Truth, or a Declaration of their Faith,</hi> pag. 81, 90, 91.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Quakers</hi> while they are handling this head in their Book called, <hi>The Principles of Truth</hi> in the pages Cited, are ſo extreamly confident of victory to their Heretical ſentiments thereupon, That they provoke and appeal all the prudent Orthodox and Learned Divines in <hi>Europe,</hi> and every Quarter of the world, with the wiſeſt of the Sons of men to produce their ſtrong reaſons, and encounter them in this point, as if, forſooth, they had intended to out-ſtrip the Devil, not only in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of lies, but alſo in his Arrogance and Pride, in daring ſo many learned and worthy Champions of the Truth. But they muſt needs run whom the Devil drives.</p>
            <p>As for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Commandment, it is moſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt how they do oppoſe themſelves thereunto, by their
<pb facs="tcp:56523:10"/>rejecting, wreſting, and abuſing the word of God, which is a moſt glorious peice of his name, and in their oppoſing and trampling upon his precious Truth, and avowing of Error and Blaſphemy; yea it is evident how lightly they regard this Commandment by their very ſwallowing down of their Meat and Drink (as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Brutes) without Prayer and Thanksgiving, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which (if they will believe the Apoſtle 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3, 4, 5.) they are not ſanctified. Let them ſeriouſly conſider the Text: for the Apoſtle does there expreſly ſay that God hath created our Meat to be received with Thanksgiving (and ſo the receiving of it without that is contrary to Gods appointment) and that every Creature of God is good, and nothing to be refuſed, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this condition taken in (and ſo no otherwiſe, <hi>viz.</hi> to us) if it be received with Thanksgiving, and he adds a reaſon to prove that its good, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe it is Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Word of God (allowing us the uſe of it) and Prayer, which asketh Gods bleſſing thereupon. And albeit the ſame Apoſtle ſays (<hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15.) <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the pure all things are pure,</hi> yet he does not ſay that without Prayer and Thanksgiving they will be ſo, or bleſſed in their uſe; nor does he in this Text contradict or retract what he ſays in the fore-cited Text where he explains how they are Sanctified and made pure to us, <hi>viz.</hi> by the Word of God and Prayer; and ſo the one Text ſupplies and explains the other.</p>
            <p>The Fourth Commandment they do openly impugn in one of their following Queries, unto which place we refer the Controverſie.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Quakers</hi> reſpects unto the Fifth Commandment is ſufficiently known by their denying to all men that external Civil Reverence which it plainly enjoyns, and their oppoſing and condemning the practice thereof in
<pb facs="tcp:56523:10"/>others as unlawful and Idolatrous. Thus Mr. <hi>George Keith</hi> one of their chiefeſt <hi>Anteſignani</hi> declares all bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and taking off of Hats unlawful, in his <hi>Quakeriſm no Popery,</hi> page 100, 101.</p>
            <p>Now that this command enjoyns us to give Civil Reverence to men is moſt manifeſt, ſeeing it enjoyns to give Civil honour to men: <hi>Ergo</hi> Civil Reverence, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing honour void of all Reverence is a plain contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, honour being nothing elſe but a paying of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and regard. And that this command enjoyns the external part, as well as the internal, cannot be doubted, ſeeing the Precept is given unto the whole man, not the Soul only; nor can the Body (being capable of the Duty) be exempted from the Law of God more than the Soul, they being equally liable to his Soveraignity, and the Law and the Law-giver not diſtinguiſhing or exempting.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Quakers</hi> object that all worſhipping of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is Idolatry: but all external Reverencing of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures with bowing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is a Worſhipping of them: <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> But why ſhall external Civil Reverence be Idolatry, and not the internal alſo, which the <hi>Quakers</hi> have often ſaid to me they own and practiſe? Is it only the Body that is capable of Idolatry? Or is not the Soul as much capable of it? Why then do they condemn, or allow the one more than the other? half an eye may ſee the Inconſiſtency and confuſion of theſe Principles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Secondly, that all worſhipping of Creatures with Religious worſhip is indeed Idolatry (<hi>Exod.</hi> 20.5. <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.10.) But worſhipping of Creatures with a Civil worſhip is not ſo, but on the contrary God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and approves it (<hi>Exod.</hi> 20.12. <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.32. <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.10.) and will they ſay that <hi>Abraham</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb facs="tcp:56523:11"/>Idolatry when he bowed to the Children of <hi>Heth (Gen.</hi> 23.7.) or that <hi>Jacob</hi> committed Idolatry when he bowed himſelf to the ground ſeven times to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that, immediately after ſuch a manifeſtation of God to him (<hi>Gen.</hi> 33.3.) or did <hi>Solomon</hi> commit Idolatry when he bowed himſelf to his Mother (1 <hi>King.</hi> 2.19.) <hi>Solomon</hi> was no Idolater at that time me-thinks.</p>
            <p>Again, the <hi>Quakers</hi> alledge that Chriſt condemns all Honouring of Creatures (<hi>Joh.</hi> 5.44.) where he ſays, how can ye believe who receive honor one of another, and ſeek not the honour that cometh from God only.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Hereby they Impugn the very letter of the Fifth Commandment, and declare that (in their Opinion) no manner of Civil Reverence or regard is to be given to any man.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if Chriſt here condemns all Civil honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of men, then he condemns that ſame Duty here which he himſelf elſewhere (<hi>Mat.</hi> 19.19. <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.20. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.2. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.17.) and his Apoſtles commands, which is moſt falſe. Therefore thirdly I anſwer that the honor that Chriſt there ſpeaks of, is meant of, the approbation and applauſe of one another as to their Life and Actions which theſe <hi>Phariſaical Jews</hi> Inordinately gaped after, and meerly relied upon, without ſeeking therein to be approved of God.</p>
            <p>This is confirmed to be the meaning from other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel Scriptures where Chriſt ſays, that theſe <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical Jews</hi> did all things for to be ſeen of men, and that they might have glory of men (<hi>Mat.</hi> 6.2, 5. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.5.) that is to ſay (as is plain) in all their works they hunted after the meer applauſe and approbation of men. And again the Text it ſelf ſhews this to be the meaning, in holding forth the receiving of the honor there meant as inconſiſtent with true Faith, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb facs="tcp:56523:11"/>agree to the receiving of that Civil honor injoyned in the Fifth Commandment; but it well agrees with that honor Taxed by Chriſt in the <hi>Phariſees</hi> both Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatively and Poſitively.</p>
            <p>We ſhall ſtand here no longer. Only it is too too notour what regard the <hi>Quakers</hi> have unto the Sixth and Ninth Commandments, while by opprobrious Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and lying Calumnies (as witneſs all their Printed Pamphlets) they bear moſt falſe witneſs againſt, and endeavour to Murther the good Name and Reputation of all men who will not Dance unto their Tune, and cry a Confederacy unto their Soul-damning Deluſions.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the avowed Principles and open Practiſes of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> by which (Chriſtian Reader) I thought it not amiſs to give thee a ſmall hint of the Superlative meaſures of Piety whereunto the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſhrewdly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that thou mighteſt from the Claw (as we ſay) diſcern the Lion, and mighteſt not be ſoon ſhaken in mind, or ſuddenly carried away with the ſpecious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> who by their huge claims unto Godlineſs (empty Casks and ſhallow Streams make moſt noiſe) and their dropping in of their Principles, eſpecially among their younger Proſelytes, under a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Enigmatical Riddles wrapt up in the chiefeſt Clouds of Darkneſs, or a miſrepreſenting and transform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Vail (whereby they are Metamorphoſed into another likeneſs, and the Snare is hid until the Prey be Catched, and the Poiſon till the Morſel be ſwallowed down) They have ſo Blind-folded the eyes, and miſled ſome ſimple and ignorant people, that having once Eſpouſed their Cauſe they are hard to be regained.</p>
            <p>Some are of mind, that it is in vain and to no purpoſe to offer to reaſon with, or redargue the <hi>Quakers,</hi> in regard of the unſtayedneſs and mutability of their Principles
<pb facs="tcp:56523:12"/>proceeding from the variableneſs of their new pretended Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. But I am more Charitable to the <hi>Quakers.</hi> For, I am ſure, though their Principles were as changeable as the Moon, and unſtayed as the Weather-cock, they muſt hold one of the parts of the Contradiction; and ſo they muſt either acknowledge and yield our Doctrine and <hi>Theſis,</hi> and then we are agreed; or elſe they muſt contradict our Doctrine and <hi>Theſis,</hi> and then let them anſwer our irreſiſtable Arguments. For they cannot hold both parts of the Contradiction, otherwiſe they ſhall contradict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and be bound to hold and maintain our doctrine, as well as their own; and ſo their Principles ſhall conſiſt of an Hodg-podge of Self-murthering contradictions each of them cutting anothers throat. Nor can they hold none of the parts of Contradiction, but proclaim both of them to be together falſe; otherwiſe they ſhall proclaim all their own Principles and Poſitions to be falſe, as well as ours (like the Witches deſtroying a Friend for a Foes ſake) for each of their Principles and Poſitions is one of the parts of a Contradiction (and ſometimes both, <hi>viz.</hi> when they aſſert formal Repugnances) and I can eaſily give a contradictory Propoſition to every one of them, or to any Propoſition imaginable; yea, if none of the parts of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction were true, then there would be no true ſaying in the world, ſeeing every true ſaying is one of the parts of a Contradiction.</p>
            <p>But here I muſt cut off, and crave thy Pardon (Courteous Reader) for preſuming ſo far upon thy good humour with ſo Large a Preface, albeit (I hope) I have loſt no time to thee, or my ſelf, either with Idle Self-Apologies, or otherwiſe vain and needleſs Complements, but have been Travelling in matters both pertinent to the purpoſe in hand, and in themſelves Important.</p>
            <p>That thou mayeſt be throughly Eſtabliſhed in the Truth of Jeſus, and mayeſt hold faſt the myſtery of Faith in a pure Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, being fruitful in every good work, receiving in end the Crown of Life is the earneſt Prayer of the Author who is</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Whether or not Grammar, or Logick, and the many Tongues and Languages which began in</hi> Babylon, <hi>is an Infallible Rule to make a Miniſter of Chriſt? and whether or not</hi> Eliſha <hi>the Plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> Amos <hi>the Herdſman,</hi> Peter, <hi>and</hi> John <hi>the Fiſhermen, who could hardly read a Letter, with many others who were not bred up in theſe things, Logick, and Grammar, and the many Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages; if they could not be Miniſters of Chriſt Jeſus? yea, or nay.</hi>

               <div type="survey">
                  <head>S<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RVEY.</head>
                  <p>Very well does the Scope of this Query agree with their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named Book, Entituled <hi>The principles of Truth;</hi> wherein (pag. 56. and 125.) they condemn all humane Learning. But the Queſtioniſt here doth, either through malice or ignorance, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the whole ſtate of the Queſtion: for who ever heard that the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> (which here he endeavours to Slander) or any other Church, made humane Arts and Sciences an Infallible rule to make a Miniſter of Chriſt? Then they ſhould never have required more of any man in order to his admiſſion to that Office, but his alone ſufficient skill in Grammar and Logick, which the Adverſaries themſelves know to be moſt falſe, and therefore we
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56523:22"/>muſt hold them for malicious Slanderers. The Infallible rule is ſet down in the firſt Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy</hi> Chapter third, and to <hi>Titus</hi> Chapter firſt; and not in <hi>Deſpauter,</hi> or <hi>Ariſtotle's</hi> School.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs Logick and Grammar are ordinary means of Knowledge, exceedingly requiſite in a Miniſter, whoſe lips ſhould preſerve Knowledge (<hi>Malac.</hi> 2.7.) and ſhould be apt to Teach, and able to convince the gainſayers (1 Tim. 3.2. Tit. 1.9.) and the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſhould have diſtinguiſhed betwixt that which is requiſite and uſeful for a Miniſter, and that which is ſufficient to make a Miniſter, ſeeing a rational faculty is requiſite and uſeful for a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter (for Beaſts and irrational Creatures would be but bad Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, me-thinks) and yet a rational faculty is not ſufficient to make a Miniſter.</p>
                  <p>But what juſt ground of Quarrel can any man have againſt Learning? Is it not commended in <hi>Daniel? (Dan.</hi> 1.4.17.) and in <hi>Moſes (Act.</hi> 7.22?) may they not ſee the excellency of Chriſts Miniſtery held forth by a compariſon with the Tongue of the Learned as an high commendation thereof (<hi>Iſai.</hi> 50.4?) and may they not ſee the loſs and diſadvantage of the want of it from <hi>Iſai.</hi> 29.12, 14. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16?</p>
                  <p>But more particularly, Grammar is an Art teaching how to Speak or Write a Language right, ſo as it may be Sence, and may be underſtood; for it ſhews the Etymology and Gender of words, and how they are Declined, Conjugated, Conſtructed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Would they then have a Miniſter not knowing how to Speak, and Write Sence? Its like that ſo he would be ſomewhat more related to the <hi>Quakers;</hi> but (I am ſure) he would be the leſs worthy of his Charge. Would they have me ſaying (like <hi>Highland-men</hi> learning <hi>Engliſh) They is man,</hi> for <hi>theſe are men?</hi> or put ſhe for he, as they do. Alaſs! what Non-ſenſe ſhould the world then be troubled with? All men that know how to Speak any Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage aright, have either Artificial Grammar, or elſe experience equivalent to Artificial Grammar; from my Cradle (for example) I have a long experience teaching me how to ſpeak <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and that is a ſort of experimental Grammar; but for learning how to ſpeak <hi>Latin, Greek, &amp;c.</hi> I was taught Rules of Grammar, as a much more expedite, ready, and accurate method of Learning.</p>
                  <p>But it would ſeem, the <hi>Quakers</hi> here by Grammar mean Foreign Languages, or their Grammar, and ſo their Quarrel is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56523:23"/>that Miniſters ſhould learn Foreign Languages, or the Grammar thereof.</p>
                  <p>But this is alſo moſt eaſie to refell; for any man may Lawfully learn a Foreign Language: therefore he may Lawfully learn the Grammar thereof, ſeeing whatever Language a man may Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully learn to ſpeak, he may learn (I hope) to ſpeak it right, and ſo as it may be Sence; or elſe it ſhall be Lawful for a man to learn to ſpeak a Language, in which it is not Lawful for him to learn to ſpeak Sence, which is ridiculous. The Antecedent I prove. If a man may not Lawfully learn Foreign Languages, then who ſhould have Tranſlated the Scriptures into our Mother-Tongue? for <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> (the original Languages wherein the Scriptures were firſt Written) are not our Mother-Tongue. Again, how ſhould the Churches of divers Nations, ſpeaking divers Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, Communicate their Gifts and Knowledge one with another, or have any Correſpondence together? or how ſhould ſuch King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms have any Commerce, if none of them might learn anothers Language, or elſe both, or all of them a third? and how ſhould <hi>Americans,</hi> and thoſe places of the World that have not as yet heard the Goſpel, ever hear it, if they ſhould not learn ſome bodies Language that have the Goſpel, or ſome body that hath the Goſpel, theirs? Theſe things prove it both Lawful and neceſſary that ſome men, eſpecially Miniſters, may learn Foreign Languages.</p>
                  <p>But, ſay the <hi>Quakers,</hi> the many Languages began in <hi>Babylon;</hi> therefore (they mean to infer) they are not Lawful among Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> But why then do the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſpeak <hi>Engliſh?</hi> for, ſure it is, that Language is no Ancienter than <hi>Babylon.</hi> When the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſhall have Taught all men to ſpeak the one Primitive Language again, then it ſhall be time to lay aſide the many Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages which began in <hi>Babylon.</hi> But what? was not the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of divers Tongues one of the Gifts of the Spirit, which he beſtowed at the Promulgation of the Goſpel to all Nations, for the more ſpeedy and eaſie publiſhing thereof (<hi>Acts.</hi> 2.4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.10?) and do they think that the day of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> when the Diſciples began to ſpeak with divers Tongues, was a day of <hi>Babels</hi> Confuſion? if the <hi>Quakers</hi> did not wilfully ſhut their Eyes they might eaſily ſee that, albeit the Diviſion of Tongues at <hi>Babel</hi> was a Judgment, making each of them ignorant of anothers
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56523:23"/>menaing; yet the knowledg of Tongues and Grammar are a bleſſing, cauſing people to underſtand one another, and ſo their effects are direct contrary.</p>
                  <p>As for Artificial or School-Logick, it is an Art or practical Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence directing our underſtanding how to Define, Divide, Judge, and Argument aright. For all the rules of Logick are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe foreſaid operations of our underſtanding, and they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed practically by way of direction, ſhewing us how to do them, both which are evident to all that know any thing of School-Logick, and we could eaſily prove it, if that were the buſineſs here controverted betwixt us and the <hi>Quakers;</hi> but it is none of their preſent controverſie with us; and if they ſhall offer to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovert that, I ſhall provoke them to inſtance (if they can) any rule of Logick which is not concerning theſe foreſaid operations of our underſtanding, and which does not proceed practically and by way of <hi>Direction,</hi> which we defie them to do. Theſe things then being ſo, it is infallibly manifeſt that if the rules of School-Logick be true, they cannot but direct us how to Define, Divide, Judge, and Argument aright, ſeeing they are all concerning theſe operations of our underſtanding, and all of them proceed practically by way of direction, ſo that if their Dictate and direction be true, they cannot direct us the wrong way, but muſt direct us aright; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe their direction ſhould be falſe, and not true. But if the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> will accuſe them of falſhood, I muſt conjure them to exhibit their reaſons: for theſe Rules of Logick being derived from, and eſtabliſhed upon the uncontrovertible and Supreme principles of the Light of Nature, of themſelves evident, and being alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by manifold experience, we cannot be ſuch Traitors to the Light of Nature and reaſon, and ſuch enemies to all experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as upon the bare ſay of any Brain-ſick <hi>Quaker</hi> to reject them. A very great Novice at Logick can eaſily demonſtrate the truth of any rule thereof irreſiſtibly.</p>
                  <p>Well then, ſeeing School-Logick directeth our underſtanding to Define, Divide, Judge, and Argument aright, it cannot but be very requiſite for a Miniſter; he that knows not how to do theſe things, wants a piece of fitneſs that ought to be in a Miniſter; or if one utterly ignorant how to do them be no leſs fit, than he who is exquiſitly skilful in them all, then <hi>Balaams</hi> Aſs ſhould be as fit to be a Miniſter as any of the Sons of men, the meaneſt of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56523:24"/>whom hath ſome portion of Logick, either Artificial, or at leaſt Natural, becauſe he is born eſſentially Rational. He that knows nothing how to Define, Divide, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (if any ſuch were) is in no better capacity than the Aſs ſpeaking to his Maſter. Take there the <hi>Quakers</hi> Miniſter very fit for <hi>Balaams</hi> Sadle if he had but four legs. Ignorance I ſee, is the Mother of the <hi>Quakers</hi> Devotion. Ye know my meaning, I hope.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Quakers</hi> have often objected to me againſt the very Lawfulneſs of Logick among Chriſtians, becauſe (ſay they) it was firſt uſed among Heathens:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Whether School-Logick was firſt uſed among Heathens or not, is not fully certain, but be it ſo or not, the conſequence is void enough of Logick, as if nothing firſt uſed among Heathens were Lawful among Chriſtians, forſooth; and ſo it ſhall not be lawful for Chriſtians to ſpeak <hi>Greek, Latin, Dutch, French,</hi> or <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or any other Language but <hi>Hebrew,</hi> which few have; and ſo they muſt ſpeak nothing at all. What ſhall we think of theſe merry principles that would make weeping <hi>Heraclitus</hi> to change his humour, and laugh to Death almoſt? But what ſhall we do with the Iſle of <hi>Britain,</hi> which (I believe) was firſt uſed by Heathens? muſt we therefore leave it? let the <hi>Quakers</hi> be firſt gone then. Again, if Artificial or School-Logick be a gift of God, and he its Author, then it cannot be unlawful among Chriſtians wherever it was firſt uſed, ſeeing the Gifts of God are not unlawful among Chriſtians; Now that it is a gift of God is evident, ſeeing it muſt either be a gift of God, or elſe a fruit of <hi>Adams</hi> Fall and mans corruption, for there is no other thing to be ſaid: But its againſt all Religion, reaſon and ſenſe, to ſay that <hi>Adams</hi> Fall or mans corruption ſhould cauſe us to underſtand how to Define, Divide, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore it muſt be a gift of God.</p>
                  <p>But ſay the <hi>Quakers, Eliſha</hi> the Ploughman, <hi>Amos</hi> the Herdſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> the Fiſhermen, were not bred up in Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar and Logick; and yet they were Miniſters of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> What then I pray? muſt all Miniſters be exactly in every point ſuch as theſe were? or is it good conſequence to argue from an extraordinary Fact to an ordinary fixed Rule? let them go on then, and argue from all the extraordinary works that God hath at any time done in the firſt publiſhing of the Law and Goſpel, unto ordinary fixed Rules; for the ſame reaſon carries all. Theſe men
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56523:24"/>being extraordinarily called of God to an extraordinary work, were by him extraordinarily furniſht with whatever was needful for their work; and ſo though by their education they acquired no Logick or Grammar, yet (beſide natural Logick, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Grammar in their Native Tongue, which they wanted not) by extraordinary Inſpiration or Infuſion, they had aſmuch of them as was requiſite for their work. Muſt God then be Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or can they tie him to do that ſame thing ordinarily, which he hath ſometimes done extraordinarily? This is a proud preſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Laws to God, not to men. We muſt therefore wait for the bleſſing of God upon our diligent uſe of the ordinary means of knowledge, and not with the <hi>Quakers</hi> (tempting God) look, without ground, for extraordinaries every day, whereof they are as ſcarce as any Society in the world beſide, for all their vain boaſting.</p>
                  <p>Behold here alſo the <hi>Quakers</hi> Blindneſs, they alledge that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> had no Grammar and Languages, whereas it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that God at the <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> (among other things) beſtowed the gift of Tongues upon them before he would ſend them forth to publiſh the Goſpel to the world, which notably enervats the adverſaries poſition, and highly commends the uſe of Grammar and Tongues.</p>

                  <hi>Or how long was it after Chriſt and the Apoſtles days, that that Grammar, Logick, and Philoſophy, and Schools of learning were ſet up to make Miniſters of Chriſt Jeſus?</hi>

               <div type="survey">
                  <head>S<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RVEY.</head>
                  <p>It ſeems the <hi>Quakers</hi> are in a perpetual Dream; for Schools of learning were ſet up before <hi>Moſes</hi>'s time, ſeeing <hi>Moſes</hi> was learned in all the wiſdom of the <hi>Egyptians (Act.</hi> 7.22.) and the Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces taught at <hi>Babylon</hi> were long before Chriſts days (<hi>Dan.</hi> 1.4.) and they were ſet up for the increaſe of Knowledge, maintaining of Equity, and the preſervation of humane Societies. But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in (I pray) can it be liable to cenſure, that every man caſt in his mite of the ſmall Reliques of Natures yet ſparkling light into the common Treaſury for the good and benefit of Mankind? for every man hath not all knowledge (to need no help of his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors gifts) but every one his ſeveral portion, which when it is
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56523:25"/>communicated, it is profitable to others, but when it is ſuppreſſed and kept up, it is a ſpark of light held Priſoner, and a portion of knowledge concealed in unrighteouſneſs. This abundantly juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies Schools of learning.</p>
                  <p>But what do the <hi>Quakers</hi> feign Philoſophy to be? Is it not an Habit or Doctrine teaching us to know God and his works, ſo far as by the light of Nature and reaſon we can reach them? Is it unlawful then to Study to know God and his works? Then an Atheiſt and a brutiſh fool (ſuch as is deſcribed <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92.6.) will be fitteſt to be a Miniſter to the <hi>Quakers.</hi> Or is it unlawful to Study to know God and his works by means of the light of Nature and reaſon: Then the Heathen world could never law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Study any knowledge of God and his works, ſeeing they had no other or better means. Nay, then the light of Nature and reaſon muſt be rejected and abandon'd as an unlawful and ſinful means for that purpoſe, and (certainly) good for no other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe imaginable, if not for that.</p>
                  <p>Now that Philoſophy teaches us to know ſomewhat concerning God and his works is moſt manifeſt. For it teaches us to know that there is a God; that he is Infinite, Eternal, Omniſcient, Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, Unchangeable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that every thing either is, or is not; that nothing can both be, and not be at once; that of every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction the one part is true, and the other falſe; that every whole is more than its part; that every cauſe is prior in Nature to its effect; that nothing can work before it exiſt; that all Creatures are changeable; that every man is a rational Creature; (the <hi>Quakers</hi> I fear ſhould be excepted) that the Soul of man is immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal; that no action can be without ſome Subject, nor without ſome Effect, nor any Union without ſome extremes; that no brute is a man, nor darkneſs any poſitive being. Theſe things (and a Thouſand times more that I may not here ſtand to reckon) Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy teaches us to know concerning God and his works, the truth whereof is evident, which if the Adverſaries queſtion, let them come forward with ſharp-edged Arguments, and not dare us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways with meer blunt aſſertions. Theſe things prove that Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy teaches us to know ſeveral things concerning God and his works. And I am ſure, thoſe that have the greateſt knowledge and deepeſt reach into theſe, and other Philoſophical principles, may lawfully communicate the ſame to others for their Inſtruction,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56523:25"/>nay, they may not lawfully conceal it in unrighteouſneſs, as is before ſhewed.</p>
                  <p>Again, Philoſophy (as I argued of Logick) is either a gift of God, and then it cannot be unlawful among Chriſtians; or elſe it is a fruit of <hi>Adams</hi> Fall and mans corruption (ſeeing God is the Author of all we have beſide) But it cannot be an effect or fruit of theſe; for what ignorant Dunce or impudent face will or dare ſay, that <hi>Adams</hi> Fall, or mans corruption hath taught men the foreſaid Principles and Concluſions of Philoſophy which were inſtanced.</p>
                  <p>What? Is it unlawful for Chriſtians to endeavour after ſome knowledge of God and his works? let them conſider and anſwer theſe Scriptures then. <hi>Job.</hi> 37.14. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.12. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92.5, 6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19, 20. Every man hath ſome Philoſophy, either Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, or elſe both that and Artificial alſo. Its a ſtrange Doctrine that Teaches, that the more ignorant Aſs a man is, he is the more fit to be a Chriſtian, or a Miniſter. <hi>Balaams</hi> Sadle-bearer would have got a better Imployment with the <hi>Quakers</hi> (it ſeems) than he had with his unthankful Maſter.</p>
                  <p>But, ſay the <hi>Quakers,</hi> the Apoſtle bids Chriſtians beware leſt any man ſpoil them through Philoſophy (<hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.8.) and we are commanded to avoid Prophane and vain Bablings, and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of Science falſly ſo called, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.20.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Apoſtle does not in theſe Texts condemn true Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy ſubſiſting within its own Sphere, neither can that be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, for the reaſons now given. But that which he condemns is ſophiſticate and corrupt Philoſophy (which we call Sophiſtry) and Philoſophy extended beyond its Sphere to the meaſuring of an Object not included within its Principles. This the Apoſtle ſhews to be his meaning, by adding Exegetically in the firſt Text cited, the Term, <hi>Vain deceit, after the Tradition of men</hi> (that is, of mens own meer Dreaming and Deviſing, having no ground in the light of Nature and reaſon, and ſo whereof God is not the Author) and by calling it in the laſt place, <hi>Science falſly ſo called;</hi> none of which can be ſaid of true Philoſophy moving within its own Orb, and not tranſgreſſing the Sphere of its activity, as is before demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated. The thing then that we are there commanded to avoid, is Sophiſticate and corrupt Philoſophy, as <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Eternity of the world; or <hi>Democritus</hi>'s opinion of the worlds being made by
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56523:26"/>the Concourſe of <hi>Atoms; Manicheus</hi>'s two ſupreme Cauſes of all things; the <hi>Platonick</hi> and <hi>Manichean</hi> conceit about the making of the Soul of man of the Divine ſubſtance; <hi>Epicurus</hi>'s mortality of the Soul of man; <hi>Pithagoras</hi>'s Tranſmigration of the Soul out of one Body into another; The Fate of the <hi>Stoicks.</hi> That and the like corrupt Philoſophy we are commanded to avoid, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide this, we are alſo commanded to beware of Philoſophy divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from its own proper uſe and object in conſidering the works of Nature, and God as the Author of Nature, to the meaſuring of Goſpel truths (which the Heathen Philoſophers in theſe times fooliſhly did) according to their Incluſion in, or Excluſion from Natural Philoſophical Principles, upon which they do not depend, but upon a Principle of an higher Order, <hi>viz.</hi> Divine Revelation. Beſide theſe two things, there is nothing elſe in Philoſophy that can be Condemned; and ſo there is nothing here againſt true and genuine Philoſophy (only which I defend) which, for our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtations given, is neither Fooloſophy, nor Witchcraft, as the <hi>Quakers</hi> in bitter Contempt have often called it in my hearing.</p>

                  <p>The principal Poſition of the <hi>Quakers</hi> upon this Head is, that there is not another Word of God beſide Chriſt the Co-ſubſtantial and Eternal Word; and this they aſſert of purpoſe, that they may elude all the Teſtimonies of Scripture which Tie us to the external written Word of God as our Rule, and whereby the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy thereof is commended: for all theſe Scripture-Teſtimonies they will have to be underſtood of Chriſt the Eternal Co-ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Word dwelling within them, and all men (as they alledg) and teaching them immediately by himſelf preſent within them, without an external written Platform, which they are pleaſed to reproach with the Nick-name of a Dead Letter, contrary to <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.31. <hi>Act.</hi> 7.28. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15, 16, 17. which places declare the written Word of God to be lively Oracles, and an excellent inſtrument of Faith, Growth, Comfort and Life un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us. See alſo <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12. where the Word of God is ſaid to be Quick and Powerful, and compared to a Two-edged Sword; and that by the Word of God here, is not meant Chriſt the Co-ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Word, but the external Word of God ſpoken within time (which Word is written in the Scriptures, as ſhall preſently be ſhewed) appears from many other Parallel places of Scripture, where the Efficacy of the external Word is held forth in moſt Parallel expreſſions, and by the very ſame Compariſon, for which ſee <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.17. (which place we ſhall preſently prove to be meant of the external Word) and <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.16. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.12, 16. <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.15. In which places by the Sword of Chriſts Mouth, and the Two-edged Sword going out of his Mouth (which are the Expreſſions there) can be no other thing meant, but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Word of Chriſt ſpoken by his Mouth, nor do I ever read that Chriſt himſelf is compared ſo, but his Word only.</p>
                  <p>It is true, the Law or legal Covenant conſidered as ſtrictly le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal (but never the whole Scriptures, which, pray obſerve) is in reſpect of guilty Sinners (ſuch as we all are) called a Killing Letter (but not at all a Dead Letter, dead Dogs neither Bark nor Bite) and a Miniſtration of Death and Condemnation (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6, 7, 9.) becauſe it Accuſeth, Curſeth, and Condemneth ſuch as are Guilty of the Breache thereof; though yet the ſame be a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56523:27"/>notable Mean to ſhew Sinners their loſtneſs without a Redeemer, and their abſolute need of Chriſt, and to Whip and laſh them home unto him. Theſe things are evident.</p>
                  <p>Now for clearing the ſtate of the main Queſtion, we muſt premiſe firſt, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> acknowledge the Scriptures to be Gods Teſtimony and Gods Words; they do not as yet (at leaſt all of them) openly deny the Scriptures to have been given by Divine Inſpiration; only they do generally deny them to be the Word of God: for (ſay they) only Chriſt is the Word of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we muſt premiſe that we do not ſay that there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Eternal, Co-ſubſtantial, or Co-equal Word of God beſide Chriſt. But that, beſide Chriſt the Co-ſubſtantial Word, there is another Word of God which was ſpoken within time written, in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which we call the external written Word. Theſe things being premiſed,</p>
                  <p>We aſſert that, beſide Chriſt the Co-ſubſtantial and Co-equal Word, there is another Word of God which is written in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. For firſt, the Commandments of God are not Chriſt the Eternal Son of God, as is clear: but the Commandments of God are the Word of God: therefore there is a Word of God which is not Chriſt the Co-ſubſtantial Word, and that Word of God is written in the Scriptures, ſeeing Gods Commandments are written there undeniably. I prove the Minor from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.172. where <hi>David</hi> calls the Commandments of God his Word; and from <hi>Mark.</hi> 7.9, 10. with 13. where that which Chriſt calls the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of God (<hi>ver.</hi> 9.) he calls it the Word of God <hi>ver.</hi> 13.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Predictions, Doctrine, and Sayings of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets (which are written in the Scriptures) are in Scripture moſt expreſly called the Word of the Lord, and yet theſe are not Chriſt the Co-ſubſtantial Word: therefore there is another Word of God (and which is written in the Scriptures) beſide Chriſt the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantial Word. The Antecedent I prove from 1 <hi>King.</hi> 16.12. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 9.36. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 23.16. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.22. <hi>Ezra.</hi> 1.1. In all theſe places the Predictions and Doctrine of theſe Prophets are moſt expreſly called the Word of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is ſaid (<hi>Iſai.</hi> 28.13.) that the Word of the Lord was unto <hi>Iſrael</hi> Precept upon Precept, and Line upon Line, where the Precepts and Doctrine contained in the Scripture-lines are
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56523:27"/>called the Word of the Lord: But (ſure it is) Chriſt himſelf is not theſe written Precepts or Doctrine: therefore there is beſide Chriſt the Co-ſubſtantial Word, another Word of God which is written in the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Hoſea</hi> calls the beginning of his Prophecies and Doctrine, The beginning of the Word of the Lord by <hi>Hoſea,</hi> which cannot be the beginning of Chriſt the Son of God by <hi>Hoſea,</hi> I am ſure; but it muſt be the beginning of the Doctrine and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies taught and Propheſied and there written by him: therefore there is, beſide Chriſt the Eternal Word, another Word of God which is written in the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, to be a Word that the Lord hath ſpoken, and to be the Word of the Lord is all one thing, me-thinks; but there is a Word which the Lord hath ſpoken, which is not Chriſt, and which is written in the Scriptures: Therefore there is a Word of the Lord, beſide Chriſt, and the ſame is written in the Scriptures. The Minor is clear from <hi>Iſai.</hi> 37.22. where the Prophet ſays, This is the Word that the Lord hath ſpoken concerning <hi>Senache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rib</hi> (and this Word is there written) <hi>The Virgin the Daughter of Sion hath deſpiſed thee,</hi> &amp;c. But ſurely, that Word is not Chriſt, Chriſt is not a complex Oration or ſaying.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, the whole Doctrine of the Prophets (if the <hi>Quakers</hi> will truſt them) is the Word of the Lord (and yet it is not Chriſt the Son of God) ſeeing they always aſcribe it to him with a, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord,</hi> and what God ſaith muſt certainly be his Word; for to ſpeak, and not ſay a word, is pretty repugnant, and may paſs for a good Jeſt amongſt men that are merry: therefore there is a Word of the Lord, beſide Chriſt, and the ſame is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Scriptures, ſeeing the Doctrine of the Prophets is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten there.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, there is a Word of God, which is the Sword of the Spirit and an Inſtrument in his hand, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.17. But Chriſt the Son of God is not the Sword of the Spirit, nor an Inſtrument in his hand, ſeeing the Second perſon of the Godhead cannot work from the Third, becauſe ſo their Order of working would quite contradict their Order of Subſiſting, which is utterly repugnant, much leſs can the Second perſon be the Inſtrument of the Third; and if by the Spirit here be meant the New man in us, Chriſt in his Perſon cannot be an Inſtrument thereof either, nor of any
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56523:28"/>Creature whatſoever that ever had a Being, or Exiſtence: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is another Word of God, beſide Chriſt the Son of God.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly (for we need ſtand no longer in a matter ſo manifeſt) The Word of Chriſt ſpoken by him within time is the Word of God, ſeeing Chriſt is God as well as man; and yet it is not Chriſt himſelf, as needs no Proof: But there is a Word of Chriſt ſpoken by him within time (and it is written in the Scriptures) <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.24. and 8.31, 37. and 12.48. and 15.3. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.8. Therefore there is, beſide Chriſt the Eternal Word, another Word of God which is ſpoken within time, and written in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                  <p>Thou wilt ſay perhaps, ſeeing moſt part of the <hi>Quakers</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to yield to the Scriptures the Title of, Gods Words, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all of them of, Gods Teſtimony, it would ſeem that this Debate is only about the naming of the Scripture. What then were the hazard to gratifie the <hi>Quakers</hi> in this point, as Wiſe men uſe to pleaſe Children and Fools ſometimes?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Though all the <hi>Quakers</hi> without exception, ſhould yield the Scriptures the Titles of, <hi>Gods Words,</hi> and <hi>Gods Teſtimony</hi> (and yet ſome of them do it not, as we ſhall ſee ere we end the Survey of this Query) yet there is a manifeſt hazard in denying the Title of the <hi>Word of God</hi> to the Scriptures. For let it once be denied (with the <hi>Quakers</hi>) that the Scriptures are the Word of God, and then (grant what they will to get their Negative once admitted) it plainly follows that they have never been ſpoken by the Mouth of the Lord (ſeeing what any perſon ſpeaks muſt needs be his Word, or elſe he ſpeaks and holds his peace, as the Jeſt is) and this puts the Scriptures into the ſame condition with the Doctrine and Dreams of falſe Prophets, and brangles their Divine Authority. See <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.20, 21. <hi>Jerem.</hi> 23.16, 21. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.7. and 22.28. Again, let it once be granted that the Scriptures are not Intituled, The <hi>Word of God,</hi> and have no Intereſt to be ſo called, and then all the Exhortations given in the Scriptures for hearkening to the Word, believing and obeying the Word, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all the commendations of its efficacy and ſweetneſs, muſt be transferred from the Word of God written in the Scriptures, unto Chriſt the Co-ſubſtantial Word im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, who as he is Jealous of his own Glory, ſo he will not
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56523:28"/>have his Word rob'd of its due Authority, and Excellency which he had Communicated thereunto. And ſo that which the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> deſign (and this is their Formal aim) in this Affair, is to take all men off from the written Word of God as their rule: for grant that ſuch a thing hath not ſuch a name, and then whatever is ſpoken under that name muſt be applyed unto ſome other Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſo named, and not unto a Subject which was never ſo named. And thus again they indeavour to overthrow the Uſe, End, and Repute of the Scriptures, ſo far as they can. And thus to deny the Scriptures the Title of, <hi>The Word of God,</hi> ſtrikes at their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority, and overthrows their uſe and regard. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are Commanded to hold faſt the Form of ſound words. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13.</p>
                  <p>But, ſay the <hi>Quakers,</hi> the Scriptures are the Words of God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. Therefore (they infer) they are not the Word of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> But ſo by the Antecedent the <hi>Quakers</hi> deſtroy their own Cauſe, and contradict themſelves; for if the Scriptures be the Words of God, then, I am ſure, there are Words of God, beſide Chriſt (and yet they deny there is any) ſeeing the written words of the Scripture are not Chriſt the Son of God. Again, this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence is as if I ſhould ſay, Such a Book contains the Doctrines of the <hi>Quakers: Ergo</hi> not the Doctrine of the <hi>Quakers.</hi> The Ten Commands are the Moral Laws: <hi>Ergo</hi> not the Moral Law. Is not that well Argued without Logick? But what? are not whole Sermons and Predictions of the Prophets, and Chriſts whole Doctrine called by them and him the Word of the Lord, and his Word, as may be ſeen in almoſt all our preceeding Arguments? Is not the whole Doctrine of the Scriptures called a Word of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy? 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19, 20. Does not <hi>Paul</hi> call the whole Reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Truths of God, Sound Doctrine, and the Doctrine of God? 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. and 6.1. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.9. and 2.10. And muſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles, Chriſt and the Holy Ghoſt learn from the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> how their Doctrine ſhould be named? will they not allow the Scriptures their Eſſential Attribute which theſe gives them, that they are the <hi>Word of God?</hi> or, albeit we very well know that there are many more words in the Scripture than one, why will they not admit of that common Unity here which is not denied in other common Natures, and a denomination conformable? By
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56523:29"/>theſe things the objection is both anſwered and overthrown.</p>
                  <p>Again, they inſinuate another Argument whereby they indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to wreſt the Title of the Word of God from the Scriptures. The Scriptures (ſay they) ſignifies Writings: Therefore (they mean to infer) they are not the Word of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> It doth equally follow; therefore they are not the Words of God, as the Word of God, as all may ſee; and ſo the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of their preſent Argument contradicts the Antecedent of their former Objection; and ſo we may ſee that the <hi>Quakers</hi> are but Jugling while they yield the Scriptures the Title of Gods Words, whereof their preſent Argument again indeavours to rob them. Secondly, our Queſtion is not what the word <hi>[Scripture]</hi> ſignifies, but what the Doctrine written in the Scriptures is, which the ſignification of that Word cannot Define. But laſtly (for clear ſatisfaction) I diſtinguiſh their Conſequent thus, <hi>viz.</hi> That becauſe the Scriptures ſignifies Writings, therefore, as to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Form and Mode which they have from the Writers Pen, they are not the Word of God, be it ſo; therefore as to their enun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciat Doctrine, or Sentence they are not the Word of God, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows not. For in the Scripture there are two things to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, <hi>viz,</hi> their Doctrine and Sentence, which is the Word of God, and their external Form or Mode which they have from the Pen of the Writer, which gives the Word of God the Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of, <hi>Written,</hi> and therefore we call the Scriptures <hi>The Written Word.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Becauſe we ſaid that the <hi>Quakers,</hi> by indeavouring to Wreſt the Title of the Word of God from the Scriptures, do ſtrike at their Divine Authority, therefore I ſhall here give a ſhort Touch of the Notes and Arguments whereby the Scriptures are clearly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated to be from God, and of Divine Inſpiration; ſuch as are the Majeſty of the Style of the Scriptures above all other Writings, under great ſimplicity of words; the Divine purity of the Doctrine, ſavoring wholly of holineſs and vertue; The Divine Scope of the Doctrine, which is to give all glory to God; The Efficacy of the Doctrine in the hearts of men above all other Doctrines in the world; The Infallible accompliſhment of the Predictions therein contained, as they were fore-told; the wonderful conſent of all the parts thereof, being written by ſo many diverſe Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſo far diſtant from one another both in time and place, which
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56523:29"/>was never to be ſeen in any other Book in the World, eſpecially of divers mens Writing; The manifold Miracles whereby God hath born Witneſs thereunto, which <hi>Satan</hi> could never ſo much as Counterfeit; The irreconcilable hatred of <hi>Satan</hi> and the World againſt it, more than againſt all other Books in the World; The firm ſtability thereof, and the ſpecial hand of God which appears in the preſerving and tranſmitting thereof from Age to Age, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the Malice of <hi>Satan,</hi> and the Devices of him and his wicked Inſtruments againſt it; The miſerable end of the greateſt Perſecutors and enemies thereof; The Teſtimony of the many Martyrs Sealing their Witneſs thereunto with their Blood, and the Teſtimony of the whole Church thereunto, which have a piece of weight in their own Order. The Scriptures cannot be from evil men, or Angels, ſeeing they ſhew their villany, denounce their Doom (which Galls them) and preſcribe a Method of living quite contrary to their Inclination.</p>
                  <p>Nor can good Angels; or Men be their Author; for, upon the one hand, they durſt not have ſo uſurped upon God, as to feign his Authority and Commiſſion to ſo many Laws, Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Threatnings, and Promiſes of their own meer Invention; and, upon the other hand, if they had done it, they could not have been good Angels or Men; Therefore the Scriptures muſt be from God himſelf. Theſe things put together (which I have but named) are ſufficient to convince that the Scriptures are from God, and of Divine Authority, and are enough irreſiſtibly to ſtop the Mouths of all Contradicters.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding, for the full aſſurance and through perſuaſion of Faith, that the Scriptures are from God, and of Divine Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Spirit is requiſite by his effectual Working in, with, and by the ſame upon our hearts and minds to Seal up their Divine Authority unto us. And yet this makes nothing in the leaſt for the <hi>Quakers,</hi> who Teach to follow a Spirit abſtracted and ſeparated from the Scriptures. For, beſide that we ſhall ſhew at the following <hi>Query,</hi> that the Spirit ſpeaking in the Scriptures, moſt ſtraitly Ties us to the Scriptures as our Supreme Rule in all matters of Faith; It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo evident that it is in, with, and by the Word of God (written in the Scriptures) that the Spirit manifeſts himſelf unto, and in our hearts, both in the enlightning of our Minds, and renewing of our Wills and Affections, as theſe Scriptures following Witneſs. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.7.8.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56523:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.41. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.26. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.3. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.20. <hi>Act.</hi> 17.11.12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 59.21. Theſe, and a Thouſand places more that I might inſtance, do manifeſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince that the written Word of God is an Organ and Inſtrument in the Spirits hand, whereby he Enlightens, Renews, and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies us more and more, himſelf alſo (as a Phyſical Cauſe does) immediately influencing the Effect, ſeeing all Effects muſt depend immediately upon God, if they include any real being.</p>
                  <p>But, ſay the <hi>Quakers,</hi> whether or not is all that is written from <hi>Geneſis</hi> to <hi>Revelation</hi> a Rule for your Faith and Manners?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> No doubt we are bound to believe all Scripture Enun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation from the beginning to the end, ſeeing all of it was given by Inſpiration of God and written for our Learning. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Luke.</hi> 24.25. <hi>Act.</hi> 24.14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.11. There is no more doubt we are bound to obey all the Commands of the Moral Law (ſeeing that is of a perpetual binding force <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.18.19.) with whatſoever is of common equity (<hi>Philip.</hi> 4.8, 9.) or whatever injoyning any piece of Religious worſhip, under the New Teſtament, doth belong to Chriſtians of our Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and condition. The <hi>Quakers</hi> muſt here be content with theſe clear generals. But as far the Ceremonial Law of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that is indeed totally Abrogated as to its Obligation (albeit yet the ſame be many ways uſeful for our Inſtruction, but eſpecially to convince us of our Natural uncleanneſs, and by the exact Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of its manifold Types in Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> to aſſure us that he is our Saviour and the True <hi>Meſſias</hi>) together with their Judicial Law, which, in ſo far as it particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected that State, is exſpired therewith, though, in ſo far as it is of common right, it ſtill obliges all men, as is eaſie to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly the <hi>Quakers</hi> inquire, whether every tittle from <hi>Geneſis</hi> to the <hi>Revelation</hi> be the Word, or the Words of God?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> It cannot be that this member of the Query is the ſame with the firſt already diſcuſſed; or elſe they have fooliſhly propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it twice to us. But to be ſhort, they ſeem here to inquire (if any new thing at all) whether every enunciation and ſentence of the Scripture be of Divine Inſpiration, and from God? Whereunto I anſwer affirmatively: for firſt, the main ſubſtantial Texts of Scripture cannot be doubted, becauſe of the Notes and Arguments before
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56523:30"/>given, moſt part whereof are Intrinſical, and do brightly ſhine in theſe with their inlightening Beams to full conviction. Secondly, for other Sentences of leſſer importance, if the <hi>Quakers</hi> will ſay that ſome ill Seed-ſower hath Inſerted them, or any of them, ſince the Writing of the Scriptures, and ſo that they are not of Divine Inſpiration, but a corruption of the Scripture; we ſhall firſt deſire them to prove their affirmative, and until then we ſhall confirm our aſſertion. For ſeeing they were found in the ſame original Language inſerted with the reſt; ſeeing they have ſtill ſome Connexion with, or Relation to the reſt; ſeeing the Scriptures were by the Providence of God kept pure in the time of the Old Teſtament, as appears in that, that Chriſt and his Apoſtles in all reproofs to the Scribes and Phariſees never Taxed them for ſuch a thing, nor at any time touches ſuch a Queſtion; ſeeing even the Writings of men may continue pure through many Ages, and if they be vitiated it can hardly eſcape diſcovery; ſeeing the Scriptures as they now are were tranſmitted to us by the Church, unto whom the Oracles of God were committed, and againſt whom the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail (<hi>Rom.</hi> 3.2. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.18.) and atteſted by her to be the true Word of God; ſeeing the very end of Gods committing his Word unto writing is for our Learning and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and that we might have hope and be Saved (<hi>Joh.</hi> 20.31. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.11.) ſeeing God cares for the feeding of Ravens, clothing of Lilies, and for our Food and Raiment, how much more (to uſe Chriſts own Argument in a matter of ſmaller moment, <hi>Luke.</hi> 12.28.) will he care for the purity of his own Word, which is of ſo weighty concernment to his Glory and his peoples Salvation. Theſe things, with Gods ſpecial Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence over his Church, duely conſidered, do ſufficiently ſecure our aſſertion; eſpecially ſeeing the <hi>Quakers</hi> cannot prove any corruption in the Scriptures, which if they affirm, they are obliged to do.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Quakers</hi> will (may be) ſay, that there are ſeveral miſtakes of men, yea and lies written of in the Scriptures, ſuch as the lies of <hi>Rahab,</hi> the <hi>Gibeonites, Sarah, &amp;c.</hi> I, and there are ſeveral Blaſphemies written of in the Scriptures too. But what ſhall follow from hence? That any enunciation of the Scripture doth Lie or Blaſpheme? Nay by no means, ſeeing theſe Lies and Blaſphemies are not Taught and Enunciat by the Scripture, or Enunciations
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56523:31"/>and Doctrines thereof; but the Narration and Hiſtory of them, is the thing Enunciat and Taught by the Scripture: for the Scriptures do not affirm what theſe perſons ſaid and affirmed; but only they affirm that ſuch perſons ſaid and affirmed ſo, which is no Lie nor Blaſphemy, as is clear. Theſe Lies therefore are not Scripture Enunciations, but are only meer complex Predicats thereof, which the Scripture Attributes to their Authors that ſaid them, as the ſubjects of its Enunciations in all ſuch Caſes.</p>
                  <p>Some <hi>Quakers</hi> are upon this Head ſo groſly Athieſtical as to ſay, that the Scriptures are but the Saints words, and Teſtimony from their own particular Experiences, unto which horrid Atheiſm their forementioned Confeſſion of Faith called, <hi>The Principles of Truth</hi> (me-thinks in Deriſion and Scorn) doth alſo poſitively ſubſcribe, pag. 100, 101, 102, 103, 127. But this impudent aſſertion of the <hi>Quakers</hi> cannot ſtand. For firſt, theſe foreſaid Notes and Arguments that we above named, do convince the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be of Divine Inſpiration and Authority, and not the meer bare word of any Creature.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this Aſſertion of the <hi>Quakers</hi> involves a violent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction; for the Pen-men of the Scriptures deliver their Doctrine in the Name and Authority of the Lord, aſſerting it to be his Word, his Will, his Command, whereof the Scriptures are every where ſo full that we need not ſtand to inſtance.</p>
                  <p>If then it was but their own meer Word and Teſtimony, theſe Pen-men of the Scripture are ſo far from being Saints, that of all men in the world they muſt have been the greateſt Cheats, and Archeſt Impoſtors and Villains, ſeeing they have delivered us ſo many meer humane Precepts and Principles for the Rule of our Faith and Duty towards God and man, promiſing Eternal Life and Glory to the Obedient, and threatning Hell and Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the Diſobedient (a terrible Preſumption for them to do by their own meer Authority, and that for Obedience or Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to their meer Commands) and beſide have wickedly Fathered all this upon God. To be Saints, and yet live and die ſuch Impoſtors and Villains is Incurably repugnant.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, except the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſhall proceed further in their Diſtraction and Atheiſm, and Aſſert the Scriptures to be a Book of Falſhoods, Fictions and Lies, they muſt acknowledge the Scriptures to be ſomewhat more than the meer bare Word and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56523:31"/>Teſtimony of any Saint, ſeeing the Old Teſtament almoſt every where Aſſerts it ſelf to be the Sayings of God; and in the New Teſtament the Doctrine and Miracles declared in the four Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels is expreſly therein aſcribed unto Chriſt who is God, aſwel as Man; The Apoſtles alſo often Aſſert the Divine Authority of their Doctrine. Except then they will conclude theſe Scriptures to be all meer Fictions and Lies, they muſt yield the Scriptures to be the Word of the Living God, either immediately declared by himſelf, or mediately by his Servants, by him unerringly directed.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the Scriptures are full of Precepts, Prohibitions, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and Threatnings: But the Relation or Narration of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience is none of all theſe: <hi>Ergo</hi> the Scriptures are not univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally (at leaſt) a Narration of Saints experiences.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, there is much Doctrine Taught in the Scriptures that could never be acquired by Experience, ſuch as, the Doctrine of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination, of the Hypoſtatical union of God and man in one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, of Juſtification by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Judgment, of the three perſons in the Godhead. And what think the <hi>Quakers</hi> of the Prophetical part of Scripture, Infallibly foretelling things at a great diſtance to come? Are theſe Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Saints Experiences? Or was the knowledge of them got by Experience? O learned Divines! Hence we may ſee that, at leaſt, ſome of the <hi>Quakers</hi> prefer themſelves and their Doctrine to the Prophets and Apoſtles and their Doctrine, which is (ſay they) but the Saints Words and Teſtimony from their own particular Experiences; but the <hi>Quakers</hi> Doctrine muſt be Divinely Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, forſooth.</p>

                  <head>SECT. I. <hi>Proving the Scriptures to be the Infallible Rule.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>The thing that the <hi>Quakers</hi> drive at in this Query, is, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Enoch, Noah,</hi> and others in the Primitive world had not a written Word of God for the Rule of their Faith; That therefore neither ſhould the Written Word of God be the Rule of our Faith. This, beſide that it is their known Principles (as Witneſſeth their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Confeſſion of Faith, called, <hi>The Principles of Truth,</hi> wherein they moſt frequently cry up the Light within every man as his only Rule, and decry the Scriptures and all external Ordinances to their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Breath, as may be ſeen pag. 5, 78, 79, 80, 92, 102, 103, 124, 133, 136, 140) Is either the Scope of this their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Query, or elſe it hath no Scope at all, and ſo it muſt be the fruit of ſome Diſtraction, they having thereby intended nothing. Well then, the <hi>Quakers</hi> muſt either acknowledge Scripture-Teſtimony for Truth (as I hope they will, ſeeing they here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire us to anſwer by Scripture) and then we ſhall ſoon ſee an end of the Queſtion from the Scripture; or elſe they muſt deny Scripture-Teſtimony to be true, and ſhall proclaim God a Lyar, whoſe Teſtimony the Scriptures are, and by whoſe Inſpiration they were given (as is proved in the former Queries Survey) which is the height of Blaſphemy.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things premiſed, I Aſſert, againſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> that the Scriptures are the Infallible Rule of our Faith and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
                  <p>That the Scriptures are Infallible is ſufficiently proved at the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56523:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>Survey of their former Query; where we proved them to be of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſpiration, and the Word of the Living God, and not of any meer Creature, and ſo they cannot deceive; ſo that for their Infallibility we need ſay no more. That therefore the Scriptures are the Rule of Faith and Manners I prove.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, That muſt be the Rule of Faith and Manners by which every matter of Faith and Manners ought to be examin'd ſeeing eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that is examined muſt be examined by its Rule, or elſe it will be done by Gueſs and Rule of Thumb, as the Jeſt is. But every matter of Faith and Manners ought to be examined by the Scriptures: <hi>Ergo</hi> the Scriptures are the Rule of Faith and Manners. The <hi>Major</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved already. I prove the <hi>Minor</hi> from <hi>Iſai.</hi> 8.20. Where we are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly Commanded to go to the Law and the Teſtimony with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry matter of Faith and Manners, and it is poſitively declared, that if it be not according to theſe, there is no Light in it, which is a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Prohibition to receive it. And the Law and Teſtimony are the Scriptures. <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.15. and 34.29. <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.24, 26. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 22.8. <hi>Neh.</hi> 8.1, 3, 8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.5.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Chriſt ſays to the <hi>Sadducees</hi> upon a great Article of Faith, that ignorance of the Scriptures cauſed them to err therein: <hi>Ergo</hi> the Scriptures are the Rule of Faith. The Antecedent is Taught by Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.29. <hi>Mark.</hi> 12.24. <hi>Ye err</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>not knowing the Scriptures, and becauſe ye know not the Scriptures.</hi> I prove the Conſequence, becauſe if the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of any other Doctrine, except the Rule of Faith, ſhould cauſe a man to err upon an Article of Faith; then though a man did perfectly know the Rule of Faith, yet he might err in the Faith through ignorance. But the Conſequent inferred is repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant (for then he knows all the Articles of his Faith, and yet he believes wrong through ignorance, that is, becauſe he knows not what to believe:) Therefore the Antecedent from which it is inferred is alſo repugnant.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Chriſt ſends all men to the Scriptures for the Rule of Faith and Duty: <hi>Ergo</hi> the Scriptures are certainly the Rule of both. The conſequence is Infallible, ſeeing Chriſt did not miſtake himſelf. The Antecedent is clear from <hi>Luke.</hi> 16.28, 29, 30, 31. Where while Chriſt is delivering his Doctrine for all men in the parable of the Rich Glutton, he ſends all men to the Scriptures for their Direction and Rule in the intire buſineſs of Repentance and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56523:33"/>Salvation, and that they may not be Eternally Damned (and ſo he ſhews we muſt ſtand to them upon pain of Damnation) and delcares, that if they liſten not to the Scriptures, there is no more hope of them, and he'l give them no other Rule to Guide and Direct them. They have <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets (ſays he) that is the Scriptures written by them, let them hear them, and if they will not hear them, one ariſen from the Dead (which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes to grant them) will not get them perſwaded. There is a bundle of Arguments in one Text proving the Scriptures to be our Rule.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the <hi>Jews</hi> at <hi>Berea</hi> are highly commended for examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Scripture the Doctrine of Grace Preached to them even by a <hi>Paul (Act.</hi> 17.11, 12.) that they might know if the things which he Taught were ſo, as the Text ſays; for albeit <hi>Paul</hi> was an infallibly-inſpired Apoſtle, yet ſeeing they knew not that, and he being but newly arrived unto them, they had no proof of his Doctrine, and there being great danger from abounding falſe Teachers, they are therefore highly commended for putting his Doctrine to the Teſt and Tryal of the Fore-conſtitute Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, wherewith every Doctrine of Religion was in ſubſtance and matter to conſent and agree, and they otherwiſe not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 8.20. Therefore the Scriptures are the undoubted Rule of Faith and Duty. The Conſequence is plain, ſeeing they would never have been commended for examining and trying his Doctrine by the Scriptures, except the Scriptures were the Rule, or for making that a Rule for examining and receiving of Doctrines of Faith, which is no Rule of matters of Faith; Nay, for this they would have been deſervedly diſcommended.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, The Scriptures are able to make us Wiſe unto Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. Therefore they contain the Rule of Faith and Duty. The Conſequence is eaſie, ſeeing without the Rule of theſe, we cannot be wiſe unto Salvation, but plainly ignorant of the way thereunto, having no Rule to direct us.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, the whole Scriptures were given by Inſpiration of God, and they were written purpoſely for the Churches Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Learning, as is before ſhewed: Therefore they muſt ſurely be the Rule of Faith and Duty; for, I am ſure, there is nothing wanting here that is requiſite to the Conſtituting of them for a publick Rule; or elſe let the <hi>Quakers</hi> (if they can) ſhew
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56523:33"/>us what that is; for I can not perceive it, without the Spectacles of their Eagle-eyed Inſpirer.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, That Doctrine muſt be the Rule of Faith and Manners, which in all matters of Faith and Manners we ought to obſerve and take heed to, as a Doctrine full of ſhining light for our inſtruction and direction: but that is the Scriptures: Therefore the Scriptures are the Rule of Faith and Manners. The <hi>Major</hi> is clear, nor do the <hi>Quakers</hi> deny it. The <hi>Minor</hi> is laid down in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19, 20. where <hi>Peter,</hi> after his rehearſing of the glorious <hi>Revelation</hi> on the Mount; at the Transfiguration (which was as glorious a <hi>Revelation</hi> as any elſe) he addeth, That they had a more ſure Word of Prophecy, whereunto they did well to take heed as unto a light ſhining, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> knowing this firſt, that no Prophecy of the Scripture is of any private Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation; here it is clear, that it is the Scriptures which he calls, the more ſure Word of Prophecy, and prefers before all tranſient Revelations; not as if the Scriptures were more certain in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>(Quoad ſe)</hi> than Gods immediate voice from Heaven; but becauſe they are a more ſure way in regard of us; <hi>(Quoad nos)</hi> they being a Written, yea Sealed and Sworn Evidence and Contract of the whole Bargain and Terms of Salvation and Life, delivered into our cuſtody to be peruſed by us upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; and this gives more aſſurance, in regard of our weakneſs, than a paſſing <hi>Revelation,</hi> and is more ready for our conſtant direction, than a tranſient <hi>Revelation,</hi> which we cannot always command, nor retain often in our memory till we underſtand; nor are all men able to bear them; That on the Mount made the Diſciples roave and miſtake exceedingly, <hi>Mark.</hi> 9.6.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Quakers</hi> anſwer, (in their Confeſſion of Faith, or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Truth, <hi>page</hi> 135, 136, 140.) That by the more ſure Word of Prophecy, the Apoſtle means the Light within us, and ſo they deny our <hi>Minor.</hi> But contrariwiſe the 20 Verſe there, where he cautions the interpreting of the Scripture-Prophecy, clearly coheres with the 19 Verſe, as a caution ſubjoyned con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſame thing which he had there called, The more ſure Word of Prophecy; and ſo by the more ſure Word of Prophecy muſt be meant the Scriptures, becauſe of the clear coherence. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, I muſt demand of the <hi>Quakers</hi> to ſhew, (if they can) How the Dictat or Light within is more ſure than Gods immediate
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56523:34"/>Voice from Heaven, ſuch as that was at the Tranſfiguration? I have ſhewed how the Scriptures are called, and are ſo in regard of us; but I cannot underſtand, how the Light within can be, or be called ſo. Thirdly, The Teſtimony of other Scriptures pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, and to be produced, will not permit this violent Gloſs.</p>
                  <p>Again, They ordinarily anſwer to this Scripture, That in it we are only appointed to take heed to the Scriptures, until the day dawn, and the day-Star ariſe into our hearts, that is (as they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound) till the Holy Ghoſt be beſtowed on us, but no longer. But contrariwiſe; Firſt, by this anſwer, they retract their former Gloſs upon the Text, and confeſs the more ſure Word of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy here, to be meant of the Scriptures, and not the Light within. Secondly, By this anſwer, they overturn one of their own chiefeſt Principles, <hi>viz.</hi> That all men ought to follow the Light within: for now they yield, That ſuch as have not receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Holy Ghoſt, (and theſe are not few) are exhorted here to follow the Scriptures, and not the Light within them. Thirdly, Hereby they inſinuate, That the Scriptures (in their Opinion) ſerve for nothing to Renewed Men and Believers, who are born of the Spirit and Sealed therewith, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13.) and ſo the Scriptures (as they will) are recommended only to Men unrenewed; and ſo that bleſſing pronounced upon the Readers, Hearers, and Keepers of the things written in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, (<hi>Revel.</hi> 1.3. and 22.7.) is deſigned and belongs only to unrenewed Men, ſeeing the reading, hearing, and keeping of the things written therein, whereunto the bleſſing is annexed, belongs only to them, as the <hi>Quakers</hi> will. What? Does not <hi>Paul, Peter,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> direct all their Epiſtles, and the Book of the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to the Churches, the Saints, and them that had obtained like precious Faith with them, delivering them many Rules of Faith and Manners therein? See their Inſcriptions (I pray,) and theſe will inform you better.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, That muſt be the Rule of Faith by which we are commanded to try the Spirits, (1 <hi>John</hi> 4.1.) ſeeing we cannot try the Spirits or Doctrines without the Rule; for that were to try them by gueſs: But that whereby we are commanded to try the Spirits, muſt certainly, be the Scriptures, ſeeing the <hi>Quakers</hi> do not as yet openly profeſs the <hi>Popiſh Lesbian</hi> Rule, of Believing as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does; and it cannot be the dictat or light
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56523:34"/>within, that we are to try them by, ſeeing, that is as fallible, as their Light whoſe Doctrines I try; and <hi>George Keith</hi> (a Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leading <hi>Quaker</hi>) confeſſes the poſſibility of their declining from Infallibility, both in Speaking and Writing, (and conſequently in Examining or Judging too) in his <hi>Quakeriſm no Popery, page</hi> 33. and beſide, the Dictat within hath no Divine Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be the Rule; and if it were the Rule, then the Dictat with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in every diverſe Man would be the Rule to try the Dictat or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine proceeding from the Dictat in another, which would make the Dictat of every Man both Superior and Inferior to the Dictat of another; Superior when it tries and examines, and Inferior when it, or its Doctrine is tried and examined, which is repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, <hi>John</hi> ſhews us, (1 <hi>John</hi> 4.6.) That the true and ſound imbracing of their Doctrine, (now written in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures) is a manifeſt evidence of the Spirit of Truth, and the rejecting of it, a manifeſt evidence of the Spirit of Error; and ſo their Doctrine written in the Scriptures, muſt be the Rule of Faith and Manners: For, How ſhall it be an evidence of the Spirit of Truth, to imbrace a Doctrine that is not the Rule? this is liker to be an evidence of the contrary; Or, How ſhall it be an evidence of the Spirit of Error, to reject ſuch Doctrine? this alſo is rather an evidence of the contrary, providing the Rule be retained.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, God denounces all the plagues mentioned in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures (quake that dreads then) againſt every Man that ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to add in matters of Faith and Duty, (for of theſe its meant) to the Doctrine and Rules written in the Scriptures. Therefore the Scriptures do certainly contain the Rule and whole Rule of Faith and Manners. The antecedent is laid down, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.18. where it is peremptorily ſaid, <hi>That if any Man ſhall add unto theſe things that are written in the Scriptures,</hi> (for there is the like reaſon, and no other, or more reaſon, againſt adding to this Book of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and the reſt of the holy Scriptures, after the Canon is compleated; and this Sanction is added here in the cloſe of this Book, as the cloſe of the whole Scriptures) <hi>God ſhall add to him all the plagues written in the Book.</hi> The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence is alſo evident: For, if not the Scriptures, but ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Doctrine were the Rule, then we not only might add to the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56523:35"/>Scriptures in matters of Faith and Duty, but we ought, of neceſſity, to ſet up that other Doctrine, as the Rule and Directory of both, which is much worſe, methinks, than any partial adding; and ſo we could not be liable to ſuch a doom for a partial adding.</p>
                  <p>And hence by a few arguments of many that may be produced, we ſee, that the Scriptures are the infallible Rule of our Faith and Manners, that ſure Word of Prophecy whereunto we ought to take heed; and if an Angel from Heaven ſhall preach another Goſpel to us, than that which Chriſt and the Apoſtles did, let him be accurſed. Every new Diſpenſation of the Covenant by the Miniſtery of Men, though it were but only new in the manner, was confirmed by Miracles and Wonders, (<hi>Exod.</hi> 4.28.30. <hi>Deut.</hi> 34.11, 12. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.4.) much more need hath the <hi>Quakers</hi> Doctrine of ſuch confirmations, being new, not only in the manner, but alſo in the matter contrary to the Doctrine formerly dictated by the Holy Ghoſt, and left upon Record unto us; nor heard we ever of ſo great a company of Inſpired Teachers, as all the Doctors of the <hi>Quakers</hi> pretend to be, and never one Miracle or Wonder to be had amongſt them all, excepting only their extream Infatuation and Brain-ſickneſs, or that they ſtill retain the proportion and features of Human bodies, having quite enervated their rational eſſence.</p>

                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:56523:35"/>
                  <p>But, I am ſure, if <hi>George Keith</hi> be in earneſt while he would have Chriſt himſelf, or the Spirit himſelf to be our Rule, he is beſide himſelf; For a Perſon cannot be a Rule of Faith, for that muſt be ſome complex Propoſition, Direction, or Precept, and the like: but Chriſt and the Spirit are Perſons, and ſo they cannot be a Rule of Faith. The <hi>Major</hi> is already proved, nor will the <hi>Quakers</hi> deny it. But <hi>George Keith</hi> (as many of his Brethren, to my hearing) doth flatly refuſe the <hi>Minor,</hi> as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain unſcriptural notion, and a barbarous heatheniſh term to ſpeak of a Perſon in the Godhead, in his <hi>Quakeriſm no Popery,</hi> page 97.104. and ſo, according to him, there are no Perſons at all in the Godhead; (ah <hi>Blaſphemy!</hi>) for if there be, I am ſure, we may ſay there are; and if Men believe that there are Three Perſons in the Godhead, they will not refuſe to ſay the ſame. The <hi>Quakers</hi> then do reject both the thing and notion, and believe not there are Three Perſons in the Godhead: And therefore that there are, I ſhall ſhortly prove.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt are each of them an Intelligent Being, ſubſiſting incommunicably, or diſtinctly from another: <hi>Ergo,</hi> each of them is a Perſon. The conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, being from the Definition to the thing defined, cannot be denied without a broad contradiction; for, if they grant the Antecedent, that is the thing which all the World underſtands by a Perſon. The Antecedent I prove, for that each of them is an Intelligent Being, Subſiſting, the <hi>Quakers</hi> dare not deny, and their great Works declare it; and that they ſubſiſt Incommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cably, or diſtinctly from one another, (though in the ſame Godhead) I prove, becauſe one and the ſame Subſiſtence cannot beget it Self, or be begotten by it Self, nor proceed from it Self, as is palpable: but the Father begets the Son, the Son is begotten by him, and the Holy Ghoſt proceeds from both; and ſo they muſt be diſtinct Subſiſtences, or ſubſiſt diſtinctly.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There are Three that bear Record in Heaven, the Father, Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.7. <hi>Ergo,</hi> they muſt either be Three Perſons, or Three Gods, (which is the beight of impoſſibility) or let the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſhew, how they will call them Three; for, though they alſo be one, <hi>viz.</hi> one God, yet the ſame Text cited, ſays they are Three too. I could never get any other anſwer to this from a <hi>Quaker,</hi> but, That they are
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56523:36"/>three Manifeſtations, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> of Chriſt, and of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit. But, if theſe were the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, the World is much elder than they, and then, Who made it?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, While Chriſt proves Himſelf the Light of the World againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> who denied it, He ſays, (<hi>John</hi> 8.17, 18.) <hi>It is alſo written in your Law, That the Teſtimony of two Men is true; I am one that bears Witneſs of my Self, and the Father that ſent Me beareth Witneſs of Me.</hi> Now Chriſt and the Father could not have been two Witneſſes according to their Law, except they be two diſtinct Perſons: for, their Law admitted the Teſtimony of two Men proof enough, becauſe it was the Teſtimony of two Perſons, and otherwiſe the Teſtimony had not been admitted as proof enough. Chriſt then clearly teaches Himſelf and the Father to be two Perſons, while he aſſerts that their Witneſſing was proof enough according to their Laws demand.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Chriſt is ſaid to be the expreſs Image (in the Original Language <hi>Character</hi>) of the Fathers Perſon; (<hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3.) Therefore the Father is a Perſon, and Chriſt alſo, and diſtinct Perſons; for the Father is plainly called ſo, and the Son being the very expreſs of his Perſon, and exact tranſumpt, muſt be one alſo, and diſtinct from the Fathers Perſon. They anſwer. The Word is wrong turned here, and, that its turned right in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. where it's called Subſtance. But contrariwiſe, the word is [<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>] in the Original, which properly ſignifies a Subſiſtence, or Perſon, and in an Intelligent Being ſubſiſting diſtinct, it always ſignifies a Perſon; and ſo the Union of Chriſts two Natures in one Perſon, is uſually called, the Hypoſtatical Union; and to turn the word Subſtance here, would be guilty of Arianiſm, and would infer, that Chriſt is not the ſame in Subſtance with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but another Subſtance like his Subſtance. It is then no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptural Notion: but theſe things by the way. Now to the main point.</p>
                  <p>I aſſert againſt <hi>George Keith</hi> and his Complices, That the Scriptures are the principal Rule of Faith and Manners, and not any Dictat within: and I prove it firſt, that the Scriptures are, and next, that the Dictat within is not.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, The Scriptures (we have ſeen already) are by Divine Authority ordained to be the Rule of our Faith and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56523:36"/>and there is no Divine Authority ordaining any other Rule, either above them, or of equal Authority with them; or elſe, let it be ſhewed, and till then, let them conſider, that we are ſtill ſent to the Scriptures as the Rule of all matters of Faith and Duty, (<hi>Iſai.</hi> 8.20. <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.29.31. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19.) but never to any Dictat within; they do not ſay, To the Dictat within; but to the Law and Teſtimony, to <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore the Scriptures are infallibly the principal Rule, ſeeing there is none above them, or equal with them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Scriptures are the Rule, ruling of Faith and Manners, and not ruled by any other Rule; or elſe, they are a Rule ruling thereof, and themſelves ruled by another ſuperior Rule; there cannot be a third thing ſaid, for the members of the diſtinction are contradictory: But the Scriptures are not a Rule ruling and ruled, ſeeing a Rule is therefore ruled by another Rule, becauſe it is not eſſentially right, but fallible and may deceive, (or elſe it needed no Rule to rule it:) but, I hope, the <hi>Quakers</hi> will not ſay, That the Scriptures are fallible and may deceive, ſeeing they are of Divine Inſpiration, and the Word or Words (as the <hi>Quakers</hi> yield) of the moſt High God: Therefore the Scriptures are the Rule ruling, and not ruled of Faith and Manners, and ſo the principal Rule thereof.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Scriptures have Intrinſecal and Eſſential Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity within themſelves, without derivation from any other Rule, (contradict who dare?) ſeeing they are the Word of God, and he deeds not (I judge) derive Authority to his Word from any other Rule, Humane or Divine: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they are the Supream and Principal Rule of Faith and Manners.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>George Keith</hi> will (may be) indeavour to retort this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as inferring, That the Dictat of the Spirit within is the principal Rule, as well as the Scriptures, ſeeing that is the Word of God, as well as they. But, by his favour, <hi>An ſit,</hi> is before <hi>Quid ſit,</hi> and <hi>Prius eſt eſſe, quam tale, vel tale eſſe;</hi> he ſhould firſt prove, that there is ſuch an infallible immediate objective Dictat (as he calls it) in every Man, and then he ſays ſomething. For I deny that there is ſuch a Dictat of the Spirit in every Man to be his Rule, ſeeing every Man hath not the Spirit, but Believers only; (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.13. <hi>Jude</hi> 19.) and if every Man have the Rule of Faith revealed to him by a Dictat within, Why
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56523:37"/>have not <hi>Americans</hi> as much knowledge of that Rule as we <hi>Chriſtians?</hi> nor do I believe, that any Man hath ſuch an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Dictat for revealing to him the Doctrine of Salvation, who can read or hear, (for others I am not concerned, nor means of;) nor is there any neceſſity thereof, that being ſo abundantly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>And whatever particular event a Man may have immediately revealed to him, and he therefore bound to believe it, This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns not our Argument concerning the Doctrine of Salvation, and the Scriptures wherein that was not contained, more than the particular commands of a Prince to one, two, or three of his Subjects, will infer that, not his publick Laws, but his private immediate commands muſt be the rule to all.</p>
                  <p>Nor needs a Believer an immediate objective Dictat to aſſure him that he is a Child of God; (as <hi>George Keith</hi> would have it) ſeeing an effective illumination of the Spirit upon our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, (which is alſo called Subjective in regard of us) open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and enlightning it's eyes to behold the Scripture-marks, and inabling it to reflect upon and diſcern the graces of the Soul in their gracious actings, will do the buſineſs infallibly, though not immediately, but <hi>per medium;</hi> for, having theſe Premiſes, and that aſſiſtance, and the mind not diverted, it will be forced to the conſequence by the clearneſs of the objective connexion, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the meaneſt Saint cannot reſiſt ſuch evidence of conſequence; nor can a thouſand Dictates within meerly objective, make a Man one whit the wiſer, without ſubjective light to perceive them, more than a Man pur-blind can ſee the Sun-ſhining, till his eyes be opened; albeit <hi>George Keith</hi> ſpurns at this diſtinction between Objective and Subjective, (which in regard of the Spirit, is called Effective) as Antichriſtian and deceitful, (in his <hi>Quakeriſm no Popery,</hi> pages 83.84.) as if he would for ever confound an Object with an Efficient Cauſe, or a Subject.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, A Rule that hath authority over all other Rules, and none over it, muſt inevitably be the Principal and Supream Rule. But the Scriptures are ſuch a Rule: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they are the Supream Principal Rule. I prove the <hi>Minor</hi> (the <hi>Major</hi> needs not) becauſe we may not receive any Rule from without, or Dictat within, which agrees not with the Scriptures, (as <hi>George Keith</hi> ſeemingly alſo confeſſes in his <hi>Quakeriſm no Popery,</hi> pag. 28.) to the Law and Teſtimony, if they agree not with that, there is
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56523:37"/>no light in them; he is Curſed that Preaches another Goſpel and not agreeing with that we have, and ſo cannot be Bleſſed that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives it; The Plagues are added to them that add to the Scripture-Rule, much more to ſuch as Teach, or receive a contrary Rule: on the other hand we may, nay, we are bound to receive the Scripture-Doctrine, though it do not agree with the Dictate within, or any other pretended Rule, as is clear from many things foreſaid, and the <hi>Quakers</hi> will not deny, ſure. Theſe things hold firm. Again, it does not hold, that we muſt not receive the Scriptures if they agree not with the Dictat within, but may receive the Dictat within, tho it diſagree with the Scriptures. And ſo the Scriptures have Authority over all other Rules, and none elſe hath Authority over them.</p>
                  <p>Now albeit we have ſufficiently already affronted the Dictate within; yet becauſe it is worthy of a Thouſand Deaths for its proud Uſurpation, we ſhall reach it ſome few Blows more <hi>in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulari Specie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt therefore, the principal Rule of Faith and Manners muſt be Eſſentially right and Infallible; or elſe we can truſt nothing to it with any aſſurance, and all were gone, it would miſlead and deceive us: But the Dictate within every man is not Eſſentially Right: <hi>Ergo</hi> it is not the principal Rule. I prove the <hi>Minor,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many men have not the Spirit, as all unrenewed men (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.13. <hi>Jud.</hi> 19.) and ſo their Dictate within, not proceeding from the Spirit, cannot be Eſſentially Right, or the principal Rule of Faith and Manners; and this deſtroys the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> Principle, that the Dictate within every man is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Rule. Nor doth the Spirit Teach even Believers by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward immediate objective Dictate, ſeeing God and Nature do nothing in vain, and Beings ought not to be multiplied without ſome neceſſity, which here there is none that can be ſhewed; for ſeeing the whole Doctrine of Salvation is abundantly made known in the Scriptures, ſo that our underſtandings being ſubjectively Enlightened, and our Eyes in any meaſure opened, we may plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee therein the exactneſs and purity of the Law, the Riches of the Promiſes, and, in fine, our whole Rule by the good help of other means and Ordinances appointed to further our Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Knowledge in theſe, by opening up and explaining their Doctrine and Sence, and ſo clearing the Object, <hi>quoad nos,</hi> or in order to our underſtanding. And what needs then (I pray) another objective Rule?</p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:56523:38"/>
                  <p>Neither is there any reaſon for the continuance of the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Inſpiration of the Doctrine of Salvation in the Church, more than all the other extraordinary Gifts (which are gone long ſince) the Intire Rule of Faith and Manners being now compleated, and publickly Recorded, which is as Infallible as any immediate Dictate, ſeeing it is the Word of God that cannot Lie; and it is more ſure for us than any, in regard of the Devils Cunning, who can, and often does bear in a ſtrong Deluſion with ſo much of ſeeming Evidence, as makes it be received for a Divine Dictate. And what needs more? <hi>George Keith</hi> who pleads that the Dictate within, is the principal Rule and Touchſtone of all Doctrines (in his <hi>Quakeriſm no Popery,</hi> pag. 59. albeit moſt inconſiſtently (as I think) he grants the ſame Authority to the Scriptures, pag. 28 thereof) does yield that, for all their Infallible Dictate, yet its poſſible for them (and that is much indeed) both to Speak and Write (and ſo to think too) in a mixture (<hi>Quakeriſm no Popery,</hi> pag. 33) that is to ſay, Fallibly: for if he means of a Mid-way betwixt, Fallibly and Infallibly, (which I am not yet acquainted with, nor ever read it) he ſpeaks, like a man in a mixture, Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Contradiction. For all the World cannot find me a midſt betwixt Fallible, and Infallible. <hi>George Keith</hi> then (it ſeems) is not Infallibly, or immediately Inſpired: for he can both Speak and Write in a mixture, which a man immediatly Inſpired can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Guilty of. <hi>Habernus confitentem reum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, that cannot be the principal Rule of Faith and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners which hath no Divine Inſtitution to Warrant it; or elſe it is but an Uſurper. But the Dictate within every, I or any man, hath no Divine Inſtitution to Warrant it to be the principal Rule of theſe; or elſe produce it (if they can) for all they have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to produced ſhall be Confuted and Anſwered too when I come to to their Objections. Therefore the Dictate within every man, or any man, is not the principal Rule of Faith and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, a Rule to be examined by another Rule cannot be the principal Rule of Faith and Manners, I am ſure: But the Dictate within all men is ſuch; Therefore it is not the principal Rule of Faith and Manners. The <hi>Minor</hi> I prove from <hi>Iſai.</hi> 8.20. To the Law and to the Teſtimony (ſays the Text) if they ſpeak not according to this Word, it is becauſe there is no Light in them;
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56523:38"/>where all Dictates, or Doctrines of Faith and Manners are very expreſly commanded to be Tryed and examined by the Scripture, and if they agree not with that, not to receive them; ſeeing ſo, there is no Light in them, they are but Dictates of Darkneſs. And again, <hi>George Keith</hi> Confeſſes, that all Doctrines and Principles of Chriſtian Religion are to be applyed to the Scriptures, as a Teſt and Touchſtone in all external Debates and Diſputations whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, and if they agree not therewith, to be denied and diſowned for ever (<hi>Quakeriſm no Popery,</hi> pag, 28.) and ſo the Scriptures are a Superiour Rule to the Dictate within (if it be a Doctrine of the Chriſtian Religion) ſeeing it muſt be examined by theſe as a Teſt and Touchſtone, and rejected, if it agree not therewith. I can ſay no more, than is dropt (twixt ſleeping and waking per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) from the Pen of an Adverſary.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the Scriptures (we have ſeen before) are the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Rule of Faith and Manners poſitively: <hi>Ergo</hi> the Dictate within cannot be ſuch a Rule. The Conſequence is plain, ſeeing two Rules, each of them poſitively principal, are repugnant; for ſo each of them ſhould be above, and below the other.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, if the Dictate within be the principal Rule of Faith and Manners, then we muſt either follow its Directions abſolutely, and without Queſtioning or Trying them; or elſe conditionally only that they be right, if conditionally only, then we muſt examine them by ſome other Rule, to know if they be right, or not; and ſo they are not the principal Rule (againſt the ſuppoſition) nor Infallible, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Infallible Rule needs no Superior Rule to be examined by, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf Eſſentially right. If then we muſt follow the directions of the Dictate within abſolutely, and without any Tryal, then he whoſe Dictate within prompts him to think that Chriſt has not two diſtinct Natures, or that he has two diſtinct Perſons aſwel as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or that he is not Co-eternal, Co-equal, and Co-ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial with the Father, or Firſt perſon, or that his Sufferings and Death was not a Satisfaction for our Sins, or that God is a Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Being ſubject to all humane Paſſions, or that in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> the Bread is ſubſtantially Changed into the Body of Chriſt, or that the <hi>Pope</hi> is Infallible (and ſo a great <hi>Quaker,</hi> or elſe each of them a ſmall <hi>Pope</hi>) or that we are not Juſtified by the Righteouſneſs of the Redeemer; I ſay, all of theſe, and other ſuch deluded Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks muſt abſolutely follow theſe Principles as their principal Rule.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56523:39"/>And if the Dictate within bid a man Worſhip the Sun and Moon, and Idols of Gold and Silver, worſhip the Devil, and cut his own Throat too, he is bound to obey his Rule. There is nothing can be anſwered to theſe things but this, <hi>viz.</hi> That theſe and ſuch like evil Directions cannot proceed from the Spirit of God, but allanerly from a mans own ſelf and the Devil. But granting all this to be moſt true, yet the Knot is not untied. For how ſhall I know and diſcern an Impoſture of the Devil meeting with my deceitful heart, from the Dictate of the Spirit, without ſome Rule to trie it by? Thou wilt anſwer, that the Dictates of the Spirit have a Self-evidence in themſelves to aſſure that they are his Dictates, and hereby they ſhall be known. But firſt, the Spirit does not now adays Inlighten us in that meaſure as to make us immediately In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired and Infallible, ſeeing <hi>George Keith</hi> himſelf may poſſibly both Speak and Write (and ſo think too) in a mixture, for all his Spirit. Secondly, all men have not the Spirit to direct them Infallibly, though he did do it to them that have him, by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Dictate. Thirdly, let the Dictate within have a Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evidence unto him to whom it is actually preſented, yet the Devil, a cunning Serpent and ſubtil Sophiſter, and a great pretended Saint too when he transforms himſelf into an Angel of Light, can preſent an Impoſture unto another man that wants that Dictate, or to him that had it at another time, but now, he at the time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent actually hath not that Dictate, with ſo much ſeeming Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence as, with the concurrence of a deceitful heart, will make it be received for a Divine Truth: for he had ſtrong Deluſions in his Treaſury (2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.11.) or Efficacious, as the word is, which mainly conſiſts in their ſeeming Evidence. What ſhall we do now, if we want a Rule to diſcern the one from the other by? <hi>viz.</hi> we'l fall into the Devils Catch-net, as before the Scriptures were Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten they were but very few that eſcaped his Snare, whereas with the ſpreading of the Scriptures into the World, the Worſhip of the true God, and Religion grew alſo; nor is the true God at this day Worſhipped where the Scriptures are wanting.</p>

                  <head>SECT. III. <hi>Anſwering the</hi> Quakers <hi>Objections.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>Firſt therefore they Object from <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.11, 12, 13, 14. Where <hi>Moſes</hi> affirms, that the Commandment which he Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> was not hidden from them, or far off, but was nigh them in their Mouth and in their Heart: Therefore the Light within in the heart is the Rule. See this Objection in the <hi>Quakers</hi> Confeſſion of Faith above-named, pag. 136.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is ſo manifeſt how ſtraitly <hi>Moſes</hi> Ties the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to the external written Word of the Scriptures (for which ſee <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.18, 19, 20. and 28.58. and 30.10. and 31.9, 10, 11. 12, 13, 26. and 32.46.) That it is a wonder that any man can be ſo impudently Effronted, as to urge this Text againſt Scripture-Rule; and for Eſtabliſhing the Light within for the Rule. It is ſure by the Scriptures Cited, and by the Context of the place Objected, that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtraitly Ties them to the Scripture-Rule; and ſo he cannot mean in the Text objected to abſolve them from it, or ſend them to the Light within as the Rule. Therefore they cannot gain their point here.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Moſes</hi> Means (as <hi>Paul</hi> expounds him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.6, 7, 8, 9. compared with verſ. 5.) of the eaſineſs of the conditions of the Covenant of Grace, in regard of the conditions of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works, which both in themſelves are more hard and difficult, and alſo want that Promiſe and Efficacy of the Spirit which is joyned with the Covenant of Grace to make it effectual. In which Sence it can make nothing at all for the <hi>Quakers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I grant that this Text further Imports that the Doctrine of the Scriptures Written by <hi>Moſes</hi> was, in regard of things neceſſary to Salvation, in ſome where or other ſo perſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and plain, that it was not hidden to theſe <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> to whom he there Speaks, but that they in ſome meaſure underſtood it, <hi>viz.</hi> ſome of them with an External, Hiſtorical, and Grammatical Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence only, as men unrenewed; others of them with a Spiritual, Internal, and ſaving Evidence alſo, as renewed men, who albeit the Object be the ſame, yet they ſee with other eyes and another Evidence then the other. But is there any thing here for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56523:40"/>of the Dictate within? Nay, neither leſs nor more; but, on the direct contrary, (comparing 9, 10. Verſes there with 15, 16, 17, 18.) he ties them to the Scriptures as their chief Rule under the pain of Death and Periſhing. But the <hi>Quakers</hi> are ſo exact at conſequences, that they can infer from any Text a flat and direct contradiction to it ſelf. Their Spirit hates Logick.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They object from <hi>Jerem. Chap.</hi> 31. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 31, 32, 33, 34. where God ſays, He will make a new Covenant with the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> not according to the Covenant he made with their Fathers when he brought them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which Covenant they brake: but this is the Covenant (ſays he) that I will make with the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> after thoſe days I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and they ſhall no more teach every Man his Neighbour and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſaying, Know the Lord: for, they ſhall all know me, ſaith the Lord: Therefore, (ſay the <hi>Quakers</hi>) What needs Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule under the New Teſtament, ſeeing the Law is written on peoples hearts? See this objection in their foreſaid Confeſſion of Faith, <hi>page</hi> 112.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, This Text will not ſerve the <hi>Quakers</hi> turn, for all men whatſoever: for theſe on whoſe hearts the Law here is to be written, are alſo to have all their iniquities forgiven, and to know the Lord, as the Text ſays: But theſe things come not to paſs in all men whatſoever; and ſo it cannot prove that the Dictat within is to be the Rule for all men whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Law was written in ſome meaſure upon the hearts of Gods People in Old Teſtament times, and yet they were ſtraitly tied to the external Scipture-rule, as was even now ſhewed; and ſo the writing of the Law upon our hearts does not abſolve us from Scripture-rule, more than them, or eſtabliſh the Dictat within for the Rule.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Law is never perfectly written upon our hearts in this Life, (as ſhall be proved at their Query concerning Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection) and the Scriptures are an effectual Inſtrument, whereby God doth more and more write his Law upon the hearts of his People, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.93. 98, 99. 104. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.26. <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.31. <hi>Act.</hi> 17.11, 12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.17. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16.) Seeing then, the Word of God written in the Scriptures
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56523:40"/>is an Inſtrument by which God writes his Law upon our hearts, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning, inſtructing, renewing, correcting us; (albeit he can work without Inſtruments, if ſo he pleaſes) it is evident, that this Text of <hi>Jeremiah</hi> is ſo far from overthrowing the External Rule of Scripture, that on the contrary, it includes it's ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate influence in the writing of the Law upon the hearts of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as a thing requiſite, ſeeing the Inſtrument of any work is requiſite to the work till it be finiſhed.</p>
                  <p>Therefore Fourthly, We ſay, that the Prophet is there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the new Diſpenſation of the Covenant under the Goſpel, with the old Diſpenſation thereof under the Law, and he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes in the Name of the Lord, That the new Diſpenſation of the Covenant ſhall be attended with a greater meaſure of the Spirit for writing the Law upon Mens hearts, than was beſtowed under the old. This Commentary agreeth with other Scriptures, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.) whereas the <hi>Quakers</hi> Gloſs is moſt falſe and contrary to the ſame, as appears from what is above ſaid in the Survey of this Query.</p>
                  <p>As for that part of the Text, They ſhall not teach every Man. his Neighbour, it is alſo a comparative expreſſion, holding forth, that the Light under the Goſpel Diſpenſation ſhall be ſo great and clear, and ſo far exceed that under the Old Teſtament, that, in compariſon with theſe under it, we ſhall ſcarce ſeem to need a Teacher, which is moſt true in the event. See the like expreſſion, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.6. <hi>I will have Mercy, and not Sacrifice;</hi> that is, (as needs no proof) he required Mercy more than Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice; for he required Sacrifice alſo.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This part of the Text, as it is urged by the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> againſt all external Teaching by the Scripture and a publick Miniſtery, doth much rather overthrow all Chriſtian mutual Teaching and Neighbourly Exhortation, than Teaching by Scripture-Rule, or a Publick Miniſtery, ſeeing the Teaching whereof it ſpeaks is, of Brother with Brother, and Neighbour with Neighbour. And ſeeing the <hi>Quakers</hi> urge this Text againſt all external Teaching under the New Teſtament, (as I in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience know they do, and their Principles of following the Dictat within leads them to it) we charge them in their own Principles, and as they would not go over the belly of their Light, to give over teaching of their Blaſphemous Errors: for there is none
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56523:41"/>buſier to teach Truth, than they (alas!) are to broach and ſpread theſe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They object from <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.20, 21. where Chriſt being asked of the Phariſees, <hi>When the Kingdom of God</hi> (that is the <hi>Meſſias</hi> Kingdom: for the Queſtion is plainly concerning that) <hi>ſhould come,</hi> He anſwers them, <hi>That the Kingdom of God comes not with obſervation: for behold</hi> (ſays He) <hi>the Kingdom of God is within you.</hi> See this objection in their <hi>Confeſſion of Faith,</hi> pages 124, 133, 134, 135.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> As to the firſt part of the Text here alledged, it is not much different from, or rather it is a conſequent of that which Chriſt ſaith before <hi>Pilate,</hi> (<hi>Joh.</hi> 18.36.) <hi>My Kingdom is not of this World,</hi> and the meaning clearly is that, becauſe the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt is Spiritual, (which that Text of <hi>John</hi> aſſerts) therefore it comes not with worldly, Pomp, and Shew, and is not conſpicuous for worldly Splendor, (which is the meaning of this Text of <hi>Luke</hi>) ſo as Men of the World can always diſcern it, as other Kingdoms: for, though it cannot be denied that Chriſt had a Kingdom even at that time amongſt the <hi>Jews;</hi> yet theſe Phariſees did not diſcern it.</p>
                  <p>But if the <hi>Quakers</hi> would have the meaning of that ſaying to be, that the Kingdom of Chriſt hath no external Laws, Rules, and Ordinances in, or with it, (unto which ſcope they do indeed wreſt it in the pages of their Confeſſion laſt cited, and in which ſence alone, and none elſe, it would ſerve the <hi>Quakers</hi> purpoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt external Ordinances, or for Eſtabliſhing their inward un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable Dictat, as all ſee) their Commentary ſhall be moſt falſe; ſeeing Chriſt had a Kingdom in the World in the days of the Old Teſtament, and a much larger in the days of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles under the New, and yet there were external Laws, Rules, and Ordinances in, or with it at both theſe times, ſee <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.10. and 31.9, 10, 11, 12, 24, 26. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8.8. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 23.2, 3. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 8.20. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19, 20. <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.29. and 22.19. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.39.46, 47. and 20.31. <hi>Act.</hi> 8.35. and 17.11. and 18.28. and 28.23. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.13. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.2. and 3.15, 16. and 4.2. Theſe Teſtimonies, and a thouſand more that might be inſtanced, do irreſiſtably prove againſt all Contradictors, that there were External Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Scripture, Sacraments, Preaching, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in, or with
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56523:41"/>the Kingdom of Chriſt, not only under the Old Teſtament, but alſo under the New; and ſo the <hi>Quakers</hi> Gloſs upon this Text of <hi>Luke</hi> is moſt falſe, That would have the Dictat within to be the Rule of Faith and Manners, becauſe the Kingdom of God comes not with obſervation, that is, as they infer, it is all within, there is nothing external in it. As for the ſecond part of the Text alledged, <hi>(Behold the Kingdom of God is within you)</hi> it may be as well, yea much better tranſlated, Behold the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God is in the midſt of you, or amongſt you: for the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> will read any of the ways, (as it is marked on the Margin of our Bibles, <hi>among you</hi>) and the nature and condition of the Party to whom Chriſt there ſpeaks, being wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Enemies of Chriſt and his Kingdom, cannot ſo well admit of our vulgar tranſlation: <hi>(The Kingdom of God is within you)</hi> and in tranſlating it the other way, it will be as much, if not more unto Chriſts Scope; for, becauſe theſe Phariſees expected that the Meſſiahs Kingdom ſhould come with worldly Pomp and Grandure, (of which conceipt neither were Chriſts own Diſciples free, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.21.) Therefore to confute that fancy, He tells them, <hi>That the Kingdom of God comes not in that manner with worldly Pomp and Splendor: for behold,</hi> (ſays He) <hi>the Kingdom of God is even now amongſt you, though ye perceive it not, becauſe ye look for a Kingdom with worldly Pomp and Grandure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Kingdom of God, that is, the Meſſiahs Kingdom, was certainly come in the Apoſtles days after the powring forth of the Spirit, and the Goſpel ſpread through the Gentile-world, (as the <hi>Quakers</hi> dare not, I think, deny) and yet it was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with External Laws and Ordinances, whereunto the Church was ſtraitly tied, (as I have many times before proved) and it was as much within Gods People then as now: Therefore this Text can afford them no ground for overturning of External Laws and Ordinances in the Church, and Eſtabliſhing their Dictate within for the Rule.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Let the Kingdom of God be within us, what then? Will that neceſſarily infer the excluſion of all External helps and means for the inchoating, promoting, and maintaining thereof in us? Nay, by no means; For how many things are there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in us, which yet are inchoate, nouriſhed and maintained
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56523:42"/>by external helps and means, as the habits of Grammar, Logick, Mathematicks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and have not all Tradeſmen their External Rules, for all their inward habit of the Art? yea, our very Lives (that are inward enough, I think) are upheld and nouriſhed by the help of things External. Why do not the <hi>Quakers</hi> nouriſh their Lives, that are Eſſentially inward, with ſome inward diſh of meat, and let alone External meat and drink? Theſe things daſh the Argument in pieces, which runs with a pur-blind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence from an infirm Antecedent.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, They object, That Chriſt promiſes to ſend his Spirit to guide us into all Truth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.13. Therefore there is no need of External Rules and Ordinances to guide us; yea, in their Confeſſion where they propound this Objection, they contend, That all External Ordinances ought to be rejected, becauſe of this promiſe of the Spirit. See their <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> pages 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82. Where they ſo triumph in this Argument, as if now they had incontrollably gained the day, and for ever baniſhed all External Ordinances out of the Church, and had no more to do, but ſing, <hi>Te Deum, Victory,</hi> We have won. But he that Reckons without his Hoſt may come to Reckon twice.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I anſwer firſt, That this promiſe is only made to Believers, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 7.38, 39. and 14.17.) and ſo it will not ſerve their turn for abſolving all Men from External Rules, and committing them to the conduct of their Dictate within.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Though they ſhould crack and rent their Brains to do it, they will never prove from hence, that the Spirit is to guide us without the Word and External Rule of Scripture: (which yet is the very thing in Controverſie, and which they muſt either prove, or elſe loſe the Cauſe, for all their boaſting) for Chriſt does not promiſe here, nor any where in Scripture, That the Spirit ſhall guide us without the written Word; and ſo from this Text, they can never prove their point.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I proved at the <hi>Survey</hi> of their third <hi>Query</hi> above, and in my Anſwer to their ſecond Objection here, That the written Word of God is an Organ and Inſtrument whereby the Spirit of God worketh upon our hearts, enlightning, converting, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowing, and quickening us thereby; and ſo the Spirit is not here promiſed to guide us without the written Word, but with it.</p>

                  <p>Laſtly, We have the word of that ſame Spirit for it, and that ſince he was poured out in the largeſt meaſure, That it is not he, but a Spirit of Error that leads men when they hearken not to the Doctrine of the Apoſtles, (which is written in the Scripture) 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.6. He exhorts us to take heed to the Scriptures, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19, 20. He affirms the Scriptures were written for our learning, and that we might have hope, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4. He af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, that the Scriptures are profitable for Reproof, Doctrine, Correction, and Inſtruction in Righteouſneſs, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. He threatens to take away their part out of the Book of Life, that diminiſh from the Scripture-rule, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.19. He pronounces them bleſſed, that read, hear, and keep the Doctrine of the Scripture, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.7. and 1.3. Whoever then rejects the Scripture-Rule, he intends not to learn, or have hope, or profit any more in the way of Righteouſneſs, or be bleſſed, but to have his part taken out of the Book of Life. Will not that Man be a good Chriſtian, and a happy Saint, no doubt? Chriſt then means nothing leſs than to abſolve us from the External Rule of Scripture in this Text of <hi>John,</hi> which the <hi>Quakers</hi> here wreſt to that purpoſe, Vaunting themſelves of an Abortive Victory which ſhall never ſee the Sun, like ſo many windy Bravadilloes, <hi>Et pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terea nihil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, They object from the firſt Epiſtle of <hi>John</hi> 2.20, 27. where Saint <hi>John</hi> ſays, <hi>But ye have an Unction from the holy One, and ye know all things, and the anointing which ye have received abideth in you, and ye need not that any Man Teach you:</hi> Therefore there is no need of External Rules and Teaching, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there is an Unction within that teaches all things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, The Apoſtle does not ſay, That all men what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever have that Unction to teach them, but only ſuch as he writes to, <hi>viz.</hi> Believers, and ſo this Text will not ſerve their turn for all men.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He does not ſay, That that anointing teaches without the External written Word; yea, in this ſame Epiſtle, (<hi>Ch.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Ch.</hi> 5.13.) He plainly ſhews the contrary, where he affirms, That thoſe that are of God hearken to (and ſo are taught by; for there is no other end of their hearkening, but to be taught) their External Doctrine, (which is written in the Scriptures) and that he wrote this ſame Epiſtle, of purpoſe, to be an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56523:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>of Faith and Knowledge unto them. And would they then force an Argument from this Epiſtle againſt Scripture-Rule? nay, there is in this Epiſtle evident demonſtrations eſtabliſhing it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We have before ſhewed, That the Spirit teaches us by the External written Word, and the <hi>Quakers</hi> with all their wranglings can never make it appear, that he teaches us without it; For, all the Texts which they produce, or can produce, prove no more, but only that the Spirit teaches us, which we never denied, but heartily acknowledge; but not one Text in all the Scriptures can prove that the Spirit teaches us without the Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Word, which is the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; and yet the <hi>Quakers</hi> by a new ſort of Logick invented by their Alogical Spirit for the abuſe of Mankind, do from every Scripture-Text where it is ſaid, That the Spirit teaches us, very bruto-rationally infer: <hi>Ergo,</hi> he teaches us without any External Mean, or Rule.</p>
                  <p>As for that of their knowing all things, it is not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of all things whatſoever, without exception, or elſe they had been too wiſe, and their knowledge too infinite: but it is meant of all things Eſſential to Salvation, which they knew in ſome meaſure, though not perfectly, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.2. and 13.9.12.) and therefore ſtill needed Scripture-Rule to teach them more knowledge. And therefore that part of the Text, That they needed not that any man ſhould teach them, is the ſame with that of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> (whereof before) and hath the ſame comparative meaning, That the knowledge of Chriſt and of the Covenant was now ſo manifeſt and clear, that having received the anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for opening the eyes of their underſtanding, <hi>viz.</hi> Effectively, (which is therefore called Eye-ſalve, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.18. which an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward objective Dictate cannot well be called) that they might be able to behold it, They in regard of, and compared with their Fathers living under the Old Teſtament Diſpenſation, did ſcarce ſeem to need a Teacher, which is moſt true. For, though they needed ſtill Teaching, yet in compariſon of them, they might all rather have been Teachers of others; and ſo the Scope of the place is to commend the New-Teſtament Diſpenſation above that of the Old, and to decry External Ordinances and Rules, or Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Men; Yea, and if it were meant ſo, then the Apoſtle did here by his Practice contradict his Doctrine, and by his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine condemned his Practice as needleſs and idle, for which he
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56523:43"/>had a ſad Accompt to make, according to Chriſts Doctrine, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.36. and if the <hi>Quakers</hi> think that this Text over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth all Teaching by Men, we again Charge them in their own Principles, and by the Law they live on, to give over their Teaching, and ſpreading of their damnable Deluſions by Word or Writ: for, I am ſure, the <hi>Quakers</hi> are but Men at the moſt, and I think, ſcarce that, by the forfeiture they have made of their Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, They object from <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.21. where the Apoſtle Exhorts us, <hi>That laying aſide all filthineſs and ſuperfluity of naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs, we would receive with meekneſs the Ingrafted Word, which is able to ſave our Souls:</hi> Therefore, (ſay they) the Word which we are to receive is an Ingrafted Word within us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, The Original word [<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>] may be as well rendred, <hi>Apt to be Ingrafted,</hi> and then where is the Argument, I pray?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The context will not allow the <hi>Quakers</hi> Gloſs: for it's a Word that we are to receive, and hear, and which is able to ſave our Souls, (a Character not given to the Light or Dictate within, any whereof Scripture, but to the Scripture it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly given, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15.) and we cannot in proper ſpeech be ſaid to receive or hear a Dictate within, which we have already, and is not audible properly: Therefore they cannot gain their point here, without diverting the words from a proper to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper ſence, for which they muſt ſhew ſome neceſſity of the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of Faith; or elſe it cannot be granted then.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Apoſtle does not here Exhort us to commit our ſelves to the conduct of the Light and Dictate within, as our Rule; but he exhorts us to receive the Word of God the length of Ingrafting, (that is, ſo as it may take root, and ſo grow and become fruitful in us) and that we let it not paſs out at one ear as it comes in at the other, being forgetful and negligent hearers; and ſo the meaning clearly is, Receive the word, not forgetfully and negligently, but receive it Ingrafted and rooting-wiſe. Any Man by reading the context downward may ſee, that <hi>James</hi> there oppoſes receiving of the Ingrafted Word, or Word Ingrafted, to the receiving of the Word forgetfully, ſuperficially and careleſly; and not to the receiving of an External Word, as the <hi>Quakers</hi> here expound, taking the grounds of their Gloſs out of their own
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56523:44"/>Brain-ſick heads alone, being no ways grounded on the Context, or agreeable to any other place of the Scripture; whereas our Expoſition is clearly founded on the Context, and evidently ariſes therefrom, and hath alſo the warrant of other Scriptures. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing here then for the <hi>Quakers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seventhly, They object wonderfully (but it's a lying wonder like the reſt) from <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1.2. where the Apoſtle Exhorts theſe <hi>Hebrews, That leaving the Principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt, they would go on towards perfection, not laying again the foundation of Repentance from dead works, and of Faith to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, of the Doctrine of Baptiſms, and laying on of hands, of the Reſurrection of the Dead, and of Eternal Judgment.</hi> See the <hi>Quakers Confeſſion,</hi> page 63, 68, 77, 80. where they urge this Text againſt the Law, (ſo they call the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures) and againſt the Prieſts, (ſo they call the Miniſters of the Goſpel, as all know) and againſt Baptiſm with Water, and the Lords Supper.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> But ſo abuſing and wreſting the Text for baniſhing of External Ordinances out of the Church, they with the ſame breath infer, That there ought, or needs not be any of the Principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt in the Church; for, the Apoſtle Exhorts to leave theſe alſo, and that in the firſt branch of the Exhortation; And did <hi>Paul</hi> (in earneſt) Exhort them to reject theſe? Did he Exhort them to reject the Foundation of Repentance and of Faith towards God, which here he calls theſe Principles? The Building will ſurely go to Ruine then, when the Foundation is gone. Is not that a brave Doctrine come from an immediate Dictate?</p>
                  <p>Any Man, though half blind, may ſee, that the Apoſtle means, that they ſhould not ſtick always at the learning of the firſt common Catechetical, or Rudimental Principles of Religion, (which he taxes them for ignorance of, in the cloſe of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Chapter) but that, having laid the Foundation of theſe, (not thrown them away, as the <hi>Quakers</hi> here expound) they ſhould aſpire and indeavour after a further Proficience and Growth in the Knowledge of Chriſt and Goſpel Myſteries.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, The <hi>Quakers</hi> object in this Query, That in the Primitive World, <hi>Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> &amp;c. had not any written Word to be the Rule of Faith and Manners;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56523:44"/>and therefore, (they mean to infer, and <hi>George Keith</hi> explains it fully in his <hi>Quakeriſm no Popery,</hi> page 109. 111.) neither now is the written Word our Rule.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> A brave conſequence forſooth; as if I ſhould ſay, Chriſt was not come in the Fleſh in the Primitive World: <hi>Ergo,</hi> neither as yet is he come. Or, in the Primitive World there were no Scriptures written: <hi>Ergo,</hi> neither afterwards. I was not born in the Primitive World, am not I born as yet then? I can hardly believe ſo: for, <hi>Non-entities</hi> cannot act and write, as I am doing juſt now. The External manner of Diſpenſation uſed with thoſe of the Primitive World, can do nothing to the <hi>Quakers</hi> now, (who live not in the Primitive World, except perhaps by conceipt and fancy) but in the laſt times, after the word of God is committed to writing, and we commanded to obſerve that as our Rule.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>George Keith,</hi> a Man more cunning than his Neighbours, albeit he acknowledges the Scriptures for a compleat External Rule, yet, he contends with all his might, That the Dictate within is the Principal Rule, and the Scriptures but a Secondary Rule, he will allow the ſecond Room, or the Footſtool to the Scriptures; but the Throne in the Palace, and chief Seat in the <hi>Quakers</hi> Synagoue muſt be reſerved for their great <hi>Diana,</hi> the Dictate within. Therefore, though this great <hi>Dagon</hi> hath broke his neck already before the Ark, yet to defend his Honour lying in the Duſt,</p>
                  <p>He objects Ninthly, (<hi>Quakeriſm no Popery,</hi> page. 9. 13.) That the Teſtimony of the Spirit within is greater than the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Teſtimony of the Scripture; and therefore the Dictate within muſt be the Principal Rule, not the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>But firſt I Anſw. That <hi>George Keith</hi> drives the Plough before the Oxen: for, he muſt firſt prove, (or elſe nothing to his point) that every Man is furniſht with an immediate Dictate of the Spirit within him (which we deny any Man to have, and he ſhall never prove) to reveal to him Infallibly the Doctrine of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and then, and not till then, it may be to the purpoſe, to prove, it's Mens principal Rule, by its Greatneſs: for be it great or ſmall, it can be no Rule to them who have it not, more than the Sun can enlighten me, when he Shines not in my Hemiſphere; and ſo the Argument is a meer impertinence: For, <hi>An ſit,</hi> is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56523:45"/>
                     <hi>Quid ſit.</hi> Let him prove then, (and he ſhall be great <hi>Apollo</hi>) that every man hath ſuch an immediate Dictate within him, and then he comes time enough to prove that it, and not the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, is his greater and more principal Rule.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, let the Teſtimony of the Light within be greater, or not, the Scriptures (we ſee) are Divinely appointed to be the Rule and principal Rule, and nothing can Infer againſt that, that the utmoſt of racked Invention is able to deviſe. Nor did, or does God always make uſe of the greater Witneſſes for Teſtifying his Will to us; or elſe he had ſtill imployed Angels, and not men to Teach us, and Chriſt had continued to this day, and the worlds end in his Miniſtery upon the Earth, inſtead of giving us men of like Paſſions to Teach us. It is plentiful ſecurity unto us, that we have a Rule of Faith and Duty altogether Infallible, and an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence Written, Sealed, and Sworn to (<hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17, 18.) deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered into our hand for our more chearful aſſurance, to be peruſed by us upon all occaſions for reſolving our doubts, directing our Duty, and confirming our Faith. <hi>George Keith</hi> uſes a number of more Arguments (in his <hi>Quakeriſm no Popery,</hi> pages 108, 109, 110, 111.) indeavouring to prove the Dictate within (and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Spirit himſelf, and ſometimes Chriſt himſelf, as his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments run) to be a better Rule than the Scriptures. But in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral they are all Guilty of the ſame very Impertinence that his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument now Diſcuſſed was liable to; and therefore the very ſame Anſwers that are given to this Argument deſtroy them every one, ſo that we need not Arraign them particularly.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>George Keith</hi> brings one Argument to prove that God Teaches us by an immediate Dictate within, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe its ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd to ſay, that God Speaks no more Intelligibly and percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in an immediate way to the Souls of his people, than to the Earth to bring forth Graſs, or to the Fiſh to Vomit out <hi>Jonah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> That he ſpeaks more Intelligibly or perceptibly to his people, than to ſuch unreaſonably Creatures as theſe, is granted; But that he does it in an immediate way to us, I deny it, let <hi>George</hi> prove it. He does indeed immediately inlighten us with a Divine Beam of Light in our underſtandings. Effectively opening our Eyes (yea he always works with his Word, made by himſelf effectual, as the immediate principal efficient of its gracious effects
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56523:45"/>in us) that we may underſtand what is written in the Scriptures, and know aſſuredly that it is he that ſpeaks to us therein; and ſo ſpeaks to us much more Intelligibly, than to unreaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, whom he never dealt ſo with.</p>
                  <p>But that it is abſurd if he do it, not by an Objective immediate inward Dictate, I utterly deny, let him prove it, if he can. But does not <hi>George Keith</hi> think it abſurd to ſay, that a man is Taught by an unerring immediate Dictate within, who cannot, upon his Life, tell how many Gods there are, or who is the Redeemer? And ſo much for the Rule of Faith and Manners ſhall ſuffice.</p>

               <head>Fifth QUERY.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whether is there any Scripture or Command in all the New Teſtament for the Sprinkling of Infants? Let us ſee Scripture, without Adding or Diminiſhing for it, that ye do not bring the Plagues upon you for it; for the Plagues are Added to them that Add: for we do expect plain Scripture from you for this, without any Shuffling Meanings, or Conſequences; or elſe never pretend Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Rule more, but acknowledge that it hath been your Meanings, and Conſequences that hath been your Rule.</hi>

               <div type="survey">
                  <head>S<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RVEY.</head>
                  <p>This Query very well Homologates with their Confeſſion of Faith often forementioned (pag. 25, 77, 79, 96, 126.) where they deny, not only Infant-Baptiſm, but moreover all Baptiſm with Water to be any Divine Ordinance belonging to the New Teſtament. But they here impoſe upon us two Conditions or Laws of our Diſputation (being the abſurd fruit of their fooliſh Dictate within) which, before we handle the main Subject of the Query (which is Baptiſm) it will not be amiſs to Diſcuſs. Theſe two Conditions are,</p>
                  <p>That we neither interpret Scripture, nor draw Conſequences there-from for Eſtabliſhing of our Doctrine, or Theſis, or elſe
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56523:46"/>that we never pretend Scripture Rule more. This Certification is ſo Important and Peremptory, that it will not be unworthy of the while to enquire into their Demands whereunto it is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed.</p>
                  <p>Therefore we muſt divide our Survey of this Query into four parts. The firſt ſhall be concerning Scripture-Interpretation; The ſecond concerning Scripture-conſequence, or Conſequential Scripture; The third concerning Baptiſm with Water; and the fourth concerning Infant-Baptiſm.</p>

                  <head>SECT. I. <hi>Concerning Scripture-Interpretation.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>While the <hi>Quakers</hi> here oppoſe Scripture-Interpretation they are indeed very like themſelves, and Speak in their own Language: for what external Ordinance can a <hi>Quaker</hi> (taking his Dictate within for his Rule) like to hear of? Therefore when they cannot get the Scriptures overthrown from being our Rule, their next in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour is, that, at leaſt, they may render uſeleſs and unedifying to the Bulk and Body of the people, aſmuch of them as they can, even all the Texts thereof (and theſe are not a few) which, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help and labours of a Gifted Interpreter, they cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand; and all the Doctrine thereof which is not explicitly and formerly Enunciat therein, though yet it be materially, really, and truly therein contained, and by ſound Conſequence Infallibly follows there-from.</p>
                  <p>One thing I ſhall here promiſe to the <hi>Quakers</hi> (and more no man can demand) and that is, that whatever Scripture I ſhall bring for proving of our Doctrine, the meaning thereof, which I ſhall alledge, ſhall either be undeniably (even to a <hi>Quaker</hi>) clear of it ſelf; or elſe I ſhall evidently and irreſiſtibly prove and make good the ſame, and manifeſtly overthrow the forged meaning of the <hi>Quakers</hi> thereupon; and, I think that is very fair. But that we may come to the Queſtions to be here handled.</p>
                  <p>I muſt premiſe firſt, that the Scriptures ought not to be Expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to any mans fore-conceived private Judgment and Opinion (that is, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> 2 <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>.</hi> 1.20.) But they are to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56523:46"/>be Expounded according to the Analogy of Faith in general, and by Compariſon with other Scriptures that Speak more clearly to the matter, or by the Scope, Connexion, and Dependence of the purpoſe in the place it ſelf, compared with its Antecedents and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequents. Thus the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, Let us Propheſie according to the proportion (in the Original Analogy) of Faith <hi>(Rom.</hi> 12.6.) and (I think) it is proved before, that the Scriptures are the Rule of all Doctrines of Faith and Manners.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I muſt premiſe, that the Scriptures are in ſeveral places ſo plain and eaſie, eſpecially in reſpect of things Eſſential, and ſimply neceſſary to Salvation, that men of very common Capacities, may even without an Interpreter, attain in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to underſtand them, as is clear both in the Scripture (<hi>Deut.</hi> 30.11. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.7. and 119.130.) and alſo from Experience. For thus we ſee that the attentive Reading, or Hearing of the Scriptures (though without Commentaries) does beget ſome meaſure of Knowledge, eſpecially of the moſt Important and Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Truths (which are therein with moſt frequency and plainneſs delivered) in men of very ordinary and common Capacities; yea, and otherwiſe, we could expect no more knowledge of theſe Truths, amongſt men of ſuch Capacity, though they ſhould never ſo much Peruſe the Scriptures, than amongſt <hi>Americans</hi> that never heard of them; and in vain ſhould ſuch men be appointed to take heed to the Scriptures (<hi>Iſai.</hi> 8.20. <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.29. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.39. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19.) if the Scriptures were every where ſo difficult and obſcure, that they could no ways underſtand them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I muſt premiſe, that for Gods Holy and Wiſe ends (for a view whereof ſee Mr. <hi>Durhams</hi> excellent Key preſixed to his Expoſition of the Song of <hi>Solomon,</hi> pages 32, 33, 34.) the Style of the Scriptures are in many other places ſo difficult and dark (I mean in reſpect of our underſtanding) that until they be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted by men called of God (though mediately) and furniſht with Gifts for that end, their particular meaning cannot be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched by men of no mean underſtanding; yea even thoſe of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt gift do not, without much diligence joyned with great capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor yet fully as to all particulars underſtand them, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by the Song of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and the many Myſtical Prophecies contained in the Books of <hi>Ezekiel, Daniel, Zechariah, Revelation, &amp;c.</hi> And yet theſe ſame obſcure places, if they be skilfully Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:56523:47"/>according to the Analogy of Faith in general, and by compariſon with other parallel places of Scripture more perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous and plain, or by the ſcope, connexion, dependance, and circumſtances of the place it ſelf, will, without difficulty be underſtood, and the ſence delivered from the foreſaid grounds, underſtood to be the true meaning of the Text, by Men of very ordinary Judgment; for many can diſcern the truth of an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, when the clear grounds thereof are repreſented diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before their eyes, who cannot by themſelves ſearch out the methods to find theſe grounds, and apply them thereunto, as is both clear in all experience, and alſo the one work (in reaſon) is much eaſier than the other. Yea the Doctrine and grounds of a Scripture-Text not a little perſpicuous, being skilfully compared (which a well gifted Interpreter, and whoſe daily work it is, is much more able to do, than Men of ordinary reach, common Endowments, and other Imploys) with the Doctrine and grounds delivered in other parallel places of Scripture in any meaſure clear, though none of the cleareſt, they do by their conſociated beams and united rays more powerfully ſhine and more copiouſly ſend forth their light, than any one of them apart could ever have done, even as a number of bright ſhining Stars being placed into one Conſtellation, do more powerfully ſhine, than any one of them apart could have done.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, I ſhall add, that the whole Scriptures were written for our Learning, and are uſeful for Edification, as appears from <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. Theſe things premiſed;</p>
                  <p>I Aſſert againſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> (who both here, and many a time to my face have denied it) That Scripture-Interpretation is neceſſary in the Church for Peoples underſtanding, or better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the Scriptures, and Edification, or further Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by them, and I prove it becauſe,</p>
                  <p>If there be many Scriptures profitable for Edification, and written for the Churches Learning, which, at leaſt, a great part, yea, the far moſt part of the Church cannot without Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion particularly underſtand, or ſo fully underſtand, and ſo be edified, or ſo far edified by them; and with the help of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation may in ſome meaſure, particularly underſtand, or more fully underſtand, and ſo receive edification, or a further edification by them; then Scripture Interpretation is needful in
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56523:47"/>the Church, that ſuch People may underſtand, or further under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand theſe Scriptures, and ſo be edified, or further edified by them, as is moſt evident: But the former is true, by our premiſed Diſcourſe preceeding: therefore the latter alſo muſt be true.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The <hi>Levites</hi> Expounded the Scriptures to the People, (<hi>Nehem.</hi> 8.7, 8.) <hi>Philip</hi> Expounded them to the <hi>Eunuch, (Act.</hi> 8.30, 31, 34, 35.) Chriſt Expounded his Parables (which are now a part of the Scriptures) to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, (<hi>Mark.</hi> 4.34.) He Expounded the Scriptures to the two Diſciples, (<hi>Luk.</hi> 24.27.) and albeit this was Chriſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding them, (as the <hi>Quakers</hi> impertinently uſe to reply unto our Argument) yet his expounding of them ſhews, that Scripture-Interpretation is uſeful and neceſſary in the Church, otherwiſe his Expounding had been a needleſs and idle work, which is a piece of Blaſphemy; (<hi>Matth.</hi> 12.36.) Therefore Scripture-Interpretation is needful in the Church; otherwiſe the Expounding thereof by the foreſaid Perſons had been a meer needleſs and idle work; and the need thereof is yet further evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, ſeeing it is plainly ſhewed, (<hi>Neh.</hi> 8.8.) that Expoſition is a mean for peoples underſtanding the Scriptures. Nor did Chriſts own Diſciples frequently underſtand his Parables, until he Expounded them, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 13.36. <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.9.) nor did the Eunuch underſtand what he read (<hi>Act.</hi> 8.30, 31.) until it was Expounded to him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Peter</hi> affirms, (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16.) That <hi>there are ſome things in</hi> Pauls <hi>Epiſtles</hi> (which are Scripture) <hi>hard to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, which the unlearned and unſtable wreſt, together with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Scriptures, to their own deſtruction:</hi> Therefore there is need of Scripture-Interpretation in the Church, ſeeing Scriptures hard to be underſtood do need explaining, that they may be underſtood, and People inſtructed and edified by them, for which purpoſe they were written; and it's needful to prevent (as much as can be) the miſtaking and wreſting of them, and Peoples falling into Soul-deſtroying Errors thereby: though all this happens through Mens ignorance and wavering humor, (as the Text ſays) and is not the Scriptures fault. Nor can it be anſwered, (as ſome do) That by <hi>ſome things</hi> here <hi>Peter</hi> does not mean ſome of the Doctrine taught by <hi>Paul,</hi> but ſome of the Extrinſecal Objects repreſented thereby, ſeeing the things
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56523:48"/>hard to be underſtood here mentioned, are ſuch as are liable to wreſting, which therefore muſt be underſtood of the Doctrine it ſelf, ſeeing that may be wreſted, but the Extrinſecal Objects cannot: for wreſting is a changing of the Sence, which belongs to Diſcourſe and Sayings. Again, where <hi>Peter</hi> ſays, <hi>That the unlearned wreſt theſe things hard to be underſtood, as alſo they do the other Scriptures,</hi> he plainly intimates, that theſe things hard to be underſtood, are themſelves Scriptures too; otherwiſe the Sence runs very ill, (I think) <hi>viz.</hi> the unlearned wreſt ſome of the External Objects of <hi>Pauls</hi> Doctrine, as alſo they do the other Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, I muſt enquire of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> if (in their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples) Men of mean capacities underſtand the Scriptures every where; as for example, all that is written in the <hi>Canticles, Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiel, Daniel, Zechariah, Revelation, &amp;c.</hi> which yet was written and is uſeful for our Learning and Inſtruction: if they ſay, Yea, I ſhall need no more to bring their Principles in diſcredit with all Men, ſeeing the whole Chriſtian World knoweth the contrary; If they ſay, Nay; then there is need of Scripture-Interpretation in the Church for explaining ſuch Scriptures by the foreſaid means, that People may underſtand them, and be edified by them, which is that we plead for.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, It is too clear in experiencce, that Men of corrupt minds, through addictedneſs to their own fore-conceived private Opinions, or through ignorance, (which by docility and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence might have been prevented or removed) or through ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice againſt the Truth, or for advancing ſome Carnal deſign, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do frequently by falſe Gloſſes and wreſted Sences, (and none buſier than <hi>Quakers</hi>) by violence indeavouring to make them ſpeak the language of their Intereſt, abuſe and caſt a miſt upon very clear Scriptures, in order to Peoples underſtanding, eſpecially of meaner capacities: Therefore it is in this caſe neceſſary by the Context, the Analogy of Faith, and compariſon with other Scriptures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That theſe Scriptures be vindicated from ſuch falſe Gloſſes, and their Genuine and true Sence demonſtated and cleared. The Antecedent needs no more proving; for (alas!) it is too manifeſt in experience, that every Erronious Teacher violently wreſts and perverts the Sence of the Scriptures, as much as he can, in favour of his Heretical Doctrine, and thereby leads
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56523:48"/>many into damnable Deluſions. The Conſequence is alſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, ſeeing when the Scriptures are abuſed and wreſted, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the preſervation of their true meaning, and ſo of the truth in the Church, and for preventing of black Soul-damning Errors, and the manifeſt ruine of poor Souls, (to ſay nothing of the Glory of God, which all Men are bound to defend according to their place and means) that they be vindicated, and their true ſence and meaning demonſtrated and cleared; and this work is eſpecially called for from ſuch as labour in the Word and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, who muſt be able to convince the Gain-ſayers of the Truth, and ſtop their Mouths, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.9, 11.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I Aſſert, (againſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> who (we ſee from their Query) deny it) That the true Genuine, and ſound Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the Scriptures is an Ordinance of Divine appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, reaching even to the end of the World. I prove it,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To teach People the Mind and Will of God from the Scriptures, is an Ordinance of Divine Inſtitution, reaching to the end of the World: But to Interpret the Scriptures truly, is to teach People the Mind and Will of God from the Scriptures: Therefore to Interpret the Scriptures truly, is an Ordinance of Divine Inſtitution, reaching to the end of the World. I eaſily prove the <hi>Major,</hi> becauſe that God hath appointed Teachers and teaching in his Church, and that unto the end of the World, till that day when all the Saints ſhall come to a ſtate of compleat Perfection, is clear from <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19, 20. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11, 12, 13. and that it is the Mind and Will of God they are appointed to teach, (I am ſure) no man can deny; and that it is from the Scriptures they ought to teach Gods Mind and Will is moſt evident, ſeeing theſe are the Rule of our Faith and Manners, and the Word of God, (as is proved before) wherein Gods Mind and Will concerning our Faith and Manners is revealed. And the immediate Inſpiring of the Doctrine of Salvation is long ſince ceaſed in the Church, as all the other extraordinary Gifts, and <hi>George Keith</hi> himſelf may both ſpeak and write in a mixture. The <hi>Minor</hi> of the Argument is alſo manifeſt, ſeeing to bring forth, ſhew, clear, and demonſtrate the Genuine and true meaning of the Scriptures, or of the Spirit ſpeaking therein, is to teach the Mind and Will of God from the Scriptures; or elſe we are not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> the wiſer concerning the Mind and Will of God in the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56523:49"/>Scriptures, by knowing the true meaning thereof, which is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> flat contradiction: But to Interpret the Scriptures truly, is to bring forth, ſhew, clear, and demonſtrate the Genuine and true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof, or of the Spirit ſpeaking therein; or elſe a true Interpretation does not make known the true meaning, which again is a contradiction: Therefore to Interpret the Scripture truly, is to teach the Mind and Will of God from the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The <hi>Levites</hi> Expounded the Scriptures to the People, (<hi>Nehem.</hi> 8.7, 8.) and their doing thereof is Recorded there as highly commendable: Therefore Scripture-Interpreting had certainly a Divine Inſtitution at that time. The Antecedent is clear in the place cited: I prove the Conſequence, becauſe if it had not been at that time of Divine Inſtitution, that practice and deed of theſe ordinary Officers of that Church would not have been commendable, but moſt blameable, as an Innovating an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> to warrant it. See <hi>Levit.</hi> 10.1, 2. <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.32. <hi>Jerem.</hi> 19.5, 6. I hope the <hi>Quakers</hi> will not ſay, that that Practice and Dee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of theſe Officers was extraordinary, and done by a particula<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> command relating only to that one ſingle action of theſe Officers, or only to theſe Individual Officers. For firſt, there is no ground can be given of ſuch an Aſſertion, and ſo it is altogether ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. Secondly, if theſe had any particular Command, let it be ſhewed. Thirdly, theſe were but ordinary Officers, and there is no footſtep of their acting extraordinarily in any thing can be be ſhewed. Laſtly, I have ſhewed before, that Scripture-Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation is ordinarily needful in the Church, for her Inſtruction and Edification; and ſo that practice of theſe <hi>Levites</hi> could not be of ſuch an extraordinary nature, as is pretended, ſeeing practices of that nature are not wont to be ordinarily needful.</p>
                  <p>Having proved that Scripture-Interpreting had a Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution under the Old Teſtament, the <hi>Quakers</hi> muſt either yield it to be an Inſtitution ſtill as yet in force, which we plead for; or elſe they muſt ſay, that Scripture-Interpreting was an Ordinance meerly <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and Ceremonial; (all which kind of Religious Ordinances are indeed abrogated) But it's moſt falſe that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Interpreting was a <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremony: for there can no ground be given for this; and ſo it muſt be reckoned a groundleſs
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56523:49"/>Fable. Secondly, Scripture-Interpretation is as yet needful in the Church we ſee: but <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremonies are not ſo, as all know. Thirdly, The Apoſtles ſtill continued and conſtantly retained Scripture-Interpretation in the New-Teſtament Church, even while they were bending their Doctrine againſt the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance and retaining of <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremonies, (for an inſtance whereof, ſee <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles to the <hi>Romans, Galatians,</hi> and <hi>Hebrews,</hi> where much of his work is the citing and explaining ſeveral Scripture-Texts of the Old-Teſtament.) But, ſure it is, the Apoſtles did not ſtill continue and conſtantly retain <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies in the New Teſtament Church, and even while they were bending their Doctrine againſt the doing thereof by others; for though the Apoſtles might ſometimes condeſcend to the practice of a ſmaller Ceremony for the weaks ſake, yet this was not a conſtant retaining of them, but only done upon ſome oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional emergencies. Therefore, ſurely, Scripture-Interpreting cannot be a <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremony.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If Scripture-Interpreting be not an Ordinance of Divine Inſtitution, and that to continue under the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Worlds end, Then though all the black Hereticks that ever were in the World ſhould at once ariſe from the dead, (and alaſs! there are too many of them ſtill alive in their Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors) and ſhould, in favour of their accurſed Deluſions, moſt groſly abuſe and wreſt the holy Scriptures, (as all Hereticks do) and pervert, invert, and deprave the meaning thereof, and ſo of God ſpeaking therein; Yet no man, even the moſt eminently gifted Miniſters of Chriſt were bound by vertue of any ſtanding Appointment, or Law of God, (otherwiſe Scripture-Interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will clearly have a ſtanding Divine Inſtitution) to ſtep out, and by the grounds of Context, the Analogy of Faith, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon with other Scriptures more clear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to refute theſe falſe wreſted meanings, vindicate the Texts abuſed, and clear and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate their Genuine and true meaning: But that is moſt falſe, abſurd, and impious. For then the moſt eminently gifted and able Miniſters of Chriſt, whoſe ſpecial Office is to labour in the Word and Doctrine, and are bound to their utmoſt (or elſe to nothing at all) to preſerve and promote the purity of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Scriptures among the people, and to convince and ſtop the mouths of the Gainſayers thereof, (<hi>Tit.</hi> 1.9, 11.) might
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56523:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>lawfully, without the breach of any ſtanding Divine Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Law, ſtand and look on, and ſee the Scriptures abuſed, perverted, and depraved in their meaning, and inſtead of their true meaning, horrible falſhoods, fictions, and blaſphemies father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon them, and ſo on God whoſe Word they are, (to the higheſt diſhonour of God imaginable, the treading under foot of the precious Truth, the over-flowing of the Chriſtian World with Soul-damning Errors, and the manifeſt ruining of poor Souls) without indeavouring to prevent, remedy, or hinder the ſame, by the exerciſe of a talent that God hath given them. If that be not abſurd, falſe, and impious, nothing can be ſuch. Nay, it involves a contradiction to ſay, that Miniſters who are required to convince the Gainſayers of the Truth, (and ſo of the true meaning of the Scriptures) and to ſtop their mouths, might lawfully ſuffer theſe things to be done, and not oppoſe themſelves for the defence of Gods truth, according to their abilities and occaſions.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Quakers</hi> being beaten from their former ſtanding, and being loth to allow us the benefit of Scripture-Interpretation, as thereby fore-ſeeing the danger of their Heretical Intereſt, do betake themſelves to another ſhift, and alledge that however neceſſary, or Divinely appointed Scripture-Interpretation may be, yet Men that are Fallible may not Interpret the Scriptures. Therefore it will be neceſſary for us to prove the contrary, which before we do, that the ſtate of the Queſtion may be cleared, I grant that theſe whoſe Explications formally as ſuch, and as raught by them are Authentical and Faith-worthy, muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be Infallible, or immediately Inſpired. The <hi>Quakers</hi> muſt ſeek after ſuch Explications as theſe, in the Canonical Writings of the Prophets and Apoſtles. For it is not ſo with the ordinary Miniſters of the Church, whoſe Explications are not formally as ſuch, and as taught by them Authentical and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, nor is it lawful for any Man ſo to receive them; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanerly upon the accompt of their agreement with, and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration from the Scriptures, whoſe Infallible Teſtimony is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to warrant and aſſure the meaning delivered.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I grant, that in the matter of Scripture-Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Supream and Magiſterial Authority from which there is no appeal, but it ought to be ſimply ſtood to, reſideth in the Scriptures themſelves, or in the Spirit their Author ſpeaking
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56523:50"/>therein, ſeeing their Verdict and Sentence in places ſpeaking to the purpoſe more clearly, and ſuch means as reſide in them, are the alone Rule and Directory of our Interpretations thereof in places more dark and obſcure, as appears from many things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid. The Authority therefore which our Miniſters have for Interpreting Scripture, is only a Miniſterial Authority for Interpreting the Scriptures by their own Verdict and Sentence, as the Rule and Judge of their Interpretations, whereunto they are Subjected, and by whoſe determination they ſtand or fall, as true Interpretations, or forged wreſtings; ſeeing the Scriptures are the Rule of Faith by which we are to try and judge Mens Doctrines in matters of Faith: having premiſed theſe things for clearing our mind, and preventing miſtakes,</p>
                  <p>I Aſſert, that Men who are not endued with an Infallible gift, and ſo are not Infallible, but Fallible, may Interpret the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And I prove it.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, Theſe <hi>Levites</hi> that expounded the Scriptures (<hi>Neh.</hi> 8.8.) were not Infallible in their Gift, ſeeing there is no proof or evidence thereof poſſible to be produced, nor had they any other extraordinary thing accompanying them in their Birth, Call, Doctrine or Works; (or elſe let it be ſhewed) nor was it any Priviledge of the Ordinary Officers of that Church to be Infallible; and yet their Practice thereof is there Recorded to their high Commendation, and as Edifying to the People: Therefore Teachers that are not Infallible may Interpret Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; Or elſe their practice thereof ſhould have been condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as unlawful, inſtead of being commended.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, A Fallible Teacher may have a far greater and more diſtinct knowledge of the meaning of the Scriptures, than many other Men alſo Fallible, ſeeing it is his ſpecial Office to labour in the Word and Doctrine, and (if he does his Duty) he is much more in ſearching of the Scriptures than Men of other particular Callings, and hath many more helps and means for it, than the commoner ſort of Chriſtians and bulk of the People, neither have all Men an equal knowledge in any thing: Therefore a Fallible Teacher may Interpret the Scriptures. The conſequence is eaſie, ſeeing whatever meaſure of Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning ſuch a Man diſcerneth beyond others, he may (I hope) ſeaſonably make it known to them for their Inſtruction and Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56523:51"/>May he not? Nay, I do not ſee ſo well how he may not.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if all that Interpret the Scriptures muſt neceſſarily upon that accompt be Infallible, then no man now adays may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to Interpret them, ſeeing there is no man now adays Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, as is before often ſhewed: But that is moſt falſe, ſeeing it is now proved, that Scripture-Interpretation is an Ordinance of Divine Inſtitution reaching to the end of the world, and ſo it binds and obliges all (according to their ability and the Churches exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency) whoſe Office it is to labour in the Word and Doctrine, and from the Word to Teach people the mind and Will of God, even to the end of the world, albeit they be not Infallible, but fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible; Nor heard I ever of a Divine Inſtitution reaching to the end of the world, and yet obliging no body; and if this oblige any man, it cannot miſs the Teachers.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, ſeeing the <hi>Quakers</hi> affirm that Scripture-Interpreting doth neceſſarily require an Infallible Gift, we muſt require them to exhibit the grounds of their affirmation; or elſe it will be readily thought that they affirm ſo without any ground; and ſo it muſt be accompted a meer blind conjecture, and a groundleſs Fable. All the ground that ever I learned from them is this, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe a man of a fallible Gift cannot aſſure people of the meaning.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is true, there can no aſſurance thereof ariſe unto them from ſuch a mans Infallibity which he hath not, and as little from a <hi>Quaker</hi> pretending to it, but can give no evidence to make it appear. But what then? can he not give them aſſurance thereof from the clear Infallible Scriptures, by whoſe Teſtimony the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is to be Demonſtrated? we are not to Build our Faith upon the mans Gift, but upon the Scriptures, that can give as great aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance as any Infallible Gift, ſeeing they are the Infallible Word of God. To the Law and to the Teſtimony; if mens Doctrines agree not with theſe, receive them not.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, I aſſert (againſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> who with peremptory Certifications ſeem to deny it in this Query) That, when the Scriptures are explained by the Scriptures, the meaning held forth and delivered is Scripture-Rule; and ſo it is no addition (as the Adverſaries here alledge) nor is it our meaning, but the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Scriptures; and ſo we may ſtill pretend Scripture-Rule, for all that. I prove it.</p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:56523:51"/>
                  <p>Firſt, the meaning of the Scriptures repreſented and Taught by themſelves is, certainly, Scripture-Rule; for ſeeing the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are our Rule (as is proved) the meaning Taught by them is the very Enunciat Doctrine, the Soul and Sentence of that Rule, as is palpable: But, when the Scriptures are explained by the Scriptures, the meaning held forth and delivered is the meaning of the Scriptures repreſented and Taught by themſelves, and the contrary involves an incurable Contradiction: Therefore, when the Scriptures are explained by the Scriptures, the meaning held forth and delivered is, certainly, Scripture-Rule.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Scripture-Doctrine Taught by the Scriptures is Scripture-Rule, or elſe nothing can be ſuch, if that be not: But, when the Scriptures are explained by the Scriptures, the meaning held forth and delivered is Scripture-Doctrine Taught by the Scriptures, ſeeing the meaning of the Scripture is, ſurely, Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Doctrine, nor can theſe be diverſe, or elſe the Scriptures ſhould mean what they Teach not, and Teach what they mean not, which is repugnant. Therefore, when the Scriptures are explained by the Scriptures, the meaning held forth and delivered is, manifeſtly, Scripture-Rule.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, if when the Scriptures are explained by themſelves the meaning held forth by them be not Scripture-Rule, then the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Rule is ſome other thing really diſtinct from the meaning of the Scriptures held forth thereby: But that is impoſſible to be, or to be explained; for ſo the Scripture-Rule ſhould by it ſelf mean nothing, ſeeing another meaning then that which is held forth by the Scriptures it can never have: <hi>Ergo,</hi> when the Scriptures are explained by themſelves, the meaning held forth is, Inevitably, Scripture-Rule.</p>
                  <p>But ſay the <hi>Quakers</hi> in this Query, Interpreting of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is an adding to them, againſt which the Plagues are De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. Chap.</p>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> This Objection proves (if it prove any thing) that all Scripture Expounding by men fallible, or not ſo, is utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, as an adding to the Scripture-Rule. But I deny that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting of the Scriptures is an adding to the Scripture-Rule (let the <hi>Quakers</hi> Try if they can prove it; for their big Aſſertion is not current for Proof) for I have ſhewed before that Scripture-Expounding is neceſſary in the Church, and of Divine Inſtitution
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56523:52"/>to the Worlds end, ſuch as adding to the Scripture Rule is not; and ſo they cannot be the ſame thing. To add to the Scriptures is to impoſe ſome falſe meaning upon them diſagreeing therewith, or to ſet up any other Doctrine as of equal Authority with them (I wiſh the <hi>Quakers</hi> would notice this, who continually impoſe falſe meanings on the Scriptures, and have ſet up a new Doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Scriptures, not only as of equal Authority with the ſame, but above them. <hi>O impudent wickedneſs!</hi> But by the Scriptures to unfold, clear, and Demonſtrate their own Genuine and true meaning hath not a ſhadow into it of adding to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Rule, ſeeing (as is proved) ſo the meaning delivered is the Scriptures own true meaning, which therefore cannot be any addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereunto. But blind Arguments are all that can be expected from Brain-ſick Doctors, whom we find frequently ſpeaking like men indeed in a mixture.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>I come now to the ſecond Imperious condition which the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> like Dictators, demand of us, and that is, that we do not draw Conſequences from the Scriptures for Eſtabliſhing our Doctrine; otherwiſe that we never pretend Scripture-Rule more. This, I confeſs, is a very unjuſt Cowardiſe, That they ſhould require us to throw down our Arms, and then they will fight us. I ſee the <hi>Quakers</hi> would fight a Dead man even out of Breath. They'l go to Wars in time of Peace. I like the Jeſt well. If the <hi>Quakers</hi> be ſo daſtardly, why did they not ſend their Queries to ſome Brute, where they ſhould have found a Party ſutable to their mind, which would not have troubled them with Conſequences. But as for us, we muſt crave their Pardon, ſeeing by our Creation and Eſſence we are Rational, which chiefly conſiſts in a Diſcurſive or Illa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Faculty fitted for diſcerning of Conſequences, of purpoſe, that being furniſht with the principles of Nature, or Grace, we might be capable to perceive the particular Concluſions which they implicitly, really and truly contain.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not need to be long in Diſcuſſing this Queſtion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Scripture-Conſequence, nor ſhall I need many words for
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:56523:52"/>clearing the ſtate of the Queſtion; but, in one word, it is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or not that which by good Conſequence is deduced and drawn from the Scriptures, be Scripture-Rule? We ſee by the Certifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Quakers</hi> demand, that they deny and take the Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the Queſtion. But,</p>
                  <p>I Aſſert that whatſoever by good Conſequence follows or is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from the Scriptures is Infallible Scripture-Rule. And I prove it.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, Scripture-Doctrine is Scripture-Rule, or elſe nothing can be ſuch. Now whatever by good Conſequence follows, or is deduced from the Scriptures muſt be Scripture-Doctrine; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a good Conſequence might infer from the Scriptures that which is not Scripture-Doctrine, or that which they Teach not; or a Conſequence inferring from the Scriptures that which they Teach not, and is not their Doctrine, ſhould be a good Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, which involves a direct Contradiction, ſeeing ſo a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence manifeſtly evil ſhould be a good Conſequence. Hence then, whatever by good Conſequence follows, or is deduced from the Scriptures is evidently Scripture-Rule.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Chriſt plainly affirms (<hi>Luk.</hi> 20.37.) that that Scripture principle, <hi>I am the God of</hi> Abraham, <hi>the God of</hi> Iſaac, <hi>and the God of</hi> Jacob, does ſhew and Teach the Reſurrection of the Dead.</p>
                  <p>Now it does not expreſly and formally Teach that, it ſays not expreſly that the Dead ſhall Riſe again; but only it follows there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from by good Conſequence, and no otherways, becauſe God, who is the God of the Living, being their God, their Duſt (which is their one half, albeit the meaner half) behooved to be Raiſed and Quickened again, as being a part of their Eſſences. Here then Chriſt Teaches that that which by good Conſequence may be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred from Scripture-principles, the ſame the Scripture ſhews and Teaches, and ſo it is Scripture-Doctrine; and ſo it is, uncontro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lably, Scripture-Rule.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if that which by good Conſequence is inferred from the Scriptures be not Scripture-Rule, then there was no Scripture-Rule in all the Old Teſtament Ordaining <hi>David,</hi> or <hi>Solomon,</hi> &amp;c. to be Circumciſed; and ſo the Circumciſing of them behooved to be a meer Will-worſhip wanting Scripture-Warrant, contrary to <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.22, 23. My Propoſition which I propounded I eaſily
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:56523:53"/>prove, for in no where of all the Old Teſtament it is in Formal and Expreſs Terms ſaid [<hi>David</hi> ſhall be, or ought to be Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed] but only by ſure Conſequence it follows from the univerſal Command for Circumciſing every Male (<hi>Gen.</hi> 17.) That therefore <hi>David</hi> ſhall be, or ought to be Circumciſed; nor is it otherwiſe to be found in all the Old Teſtament.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Quakers</hi> then muſt admit that particular Concluſion by good Conſequence following from the univerſal Command to be Scripture-Rule (and ſo that which by good Conſequence follows from Scripture-principles to be Scripture-Rule) or elſe they muſt deny that there was any Scripture-Rule in all the Old Teſtament Ordaining <hi>David</hi> to be Circumciſed; for its impoſſible there ſhould be any Scripture-Rule Ordaining <hi>David</hi> to be Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, except it be a Scripture-Rule that <hi>David</hi> ought to be Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed; or elſe he was both Ordained to be, and yet ought not to be Circumciſed at once.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, if that which by good Conſequence is inferred from the Scriptures be not Scripture-Rule, then there is no Scripture-Rule in all the Old Teſtament Teſtifying and Witneſſing that, <hi>Jeſus the Son of</hi> Mary <hi>is the Saviour of the world,</hi> which is moſt falſe, and contrary to the Scriptures, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.39, 46. <hi>Act.</hi> 10.43. and 18.28. and 28.23. My Propoſition which I laid down I prove, becauſe it is no where of all the Old Teſtament in expreſs Terms ſaid that <hi>Jeſus the Son of</hi> Mary <hi>is the Saviour of the world;</hi> But by Infallible Conſequence it follows, and may be inferred from many of the Old Teſtament Scripture-principles; nor is it otherwiſe but by good Conſequence therein to be found. It muſt therefore be granted, that that particular Concluſion, which by good Conſequence follows from theſe Old Teſtament Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>principles, and is no otherwiſe to be found therein, is Scripture-Rule, which is that we plead for; or elſe they muſt deny that there is any Scripture-Rule in all the Old Teſtament, Teſtifying and Witneſſing that <hi>Jeſus the Son of</hi> Mary <hi>is the Saviour of the world;</hi> for there cannot be Scripture-Rule Witneſſing and ſhewing that <hi>Jeſus the Son of</hi> Mary <hi>is the Saviour,</hi> except it be a Scripture-Rule that <hi>Jeſus the Son of</hi> Mary <hi>is the Saviour;</hi> otherwiſe the Scriptures Teſtifying that, ſhall be Scripture-Rule (as is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed) and yet the very ſubſtantial Doctrine of their Teſtimony ſhall not be Scripture-Rule, which is repugnant.</p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:56523:53"/>
                  <p>Laſtly, If that which by good conſequence follows from Scripture-Principles be not Scripture-Rule, then we are no where in all the Scriptures forbidden to worſhip a Dog, or Cat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is a moſt abſurd falſhood, ſeeing then the worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of theſe things could be no tranſgreſſion of the Law of God; for the whole Law of God is delivered to us in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; otherwiſe the Scriptures would be defective, and not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt our whole Duty in order to Salvation, which is contrary to <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.32. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 8.20. <hi>Luc.</hi> 16.28, 29. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.18. My propoſition laid down, I evidently prove: for it is not in formal and expreſs Terms ſaid in all the Scriptures, Thou ſhalt not worſhip a Dog, or Cat, albeit it is expreſly ſaid, That we ſhall have no other Gods but the true God, and ſhall Worſhip and Serve him only, (<hi>Exod.</hi> 20.3. <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.10.) from whence by evident conſequence it follows, (but not without a conſequence in all the Scriptures) that we may not Worſhip a Dog, or Cat. Will the <hi>Quakers</hi> then deny the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of theſe Creatures to be forbidden in the Scriptures, and ſo to be unlawful, becauſe without a Conſequence we cannot get any Scripture forbidding it, and whereby to prove it unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful? If they ſtand to their Principles here, of neceſſity they muſt do it, as the Argument irreſiſtibly infers upon them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Quakers</hi> may hence ſee how juſtly we may as yet pretend Scripture-Rule, notwithſtanding our conſequences, ſeeing we have unanſwerably proved, that that which by good conſequence is inferred from Scripture-Principles is Scripture-Rule; and we have convinced their wild Principles in this point to daſh and run upon contradictions, to diſagree from the Doctrine and Practice of Chriſt, to make way for denying Jeſus the Son of <hi>Mary</hi> to be the Saviour of the World, (for the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament do by clear conſequence, though not without a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, mightily witneſs and aſſure that great Article of Faith) and to lead the way to Will-Worſhip in the Church, yea, for the groſſeſt of Idolatry. We ſee then how little reaſon we have to grant theſe impious demands of the <hi>Quakers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Quakers</hi> here object, That to draw conſequences from the Scriptures, is to add to the Scripture-Rule, againſt which all the plagues in the book of God are denounced.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> By this Objection, the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſhew how unlawful they
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:56523:54"/>think Scripture-Conſequences to be. But I have abundantly ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that that which by good conſequence is inferred from Scripture-Principles, is no addition to the Scripture-Rule, but is it ſelf very Scripture-Rule; and how ſhould it be an adding to Scripture-Rule to draw forth more expreſly and diſtinctly, by conſequence, the ſame Doctrine which it really and truly teaches, though more Implicitly? Is it an adding to the Scripture to ſhew more expreſly it's own Doctrine? Then the Scriptures own Doctrine ſhould be an addition to the Scripture-Rule: they have a great dexterity in ſpeaking of Contradictions.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It uſes to be objected, That if that which by good conſequence is inferred from Scripture-Principles be Scripture-Rule, and ſo a Rule of Divine Faith, then our Divine Faith whereby we believe that Scripture-Rule ſo inferred, ſhall ſtand upon reaſon, (which is moſt abſurd) ſeeing the inferring of a conſequence is an act of reaſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I deny the Sequel, or conſequence of the <hi>Major</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; becauſe when a concluſion is by good conſequence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred from Scripture-Principles, Reaſon is not the Argument or Motive wherefrom the concluſion follows and is inferred, and moves and conſtrains us to aſſent thereunto, ſeeing the Concluſion is not inferred from the natural Principles or Premiſes of Reaſon, but from Supernatural Scripture-Principles, as is moſt manifeſt.</p>
                  <p>Reaſon therefore is only requiſite here as a neceſſary Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for perceiving and diſcerning the conſequence, or connexion of the Antecedent with the Conſequent, which way it is indeed requiſite; yea, ſo Reaſon is requiſite for perceiving every word of God, and without it we ſhould not be capable of the Principles of Religion more than Brutes are. So alſo our Ears are a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Inſtrument for hearing the Word Preached, or Read, and our Eyes for Reading of it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It uſes to be objected, That the Goſpel is above Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Goſpel is above Reaſon, in regard of the matter and myſteries which it teaches, which Reaſon cannot reach or underſtand; but not in reſpect of the manner how it teaches them, which is ſuited and accommodated to human capacity; Or elſe no Man, upon the accompt that he is endued with Reaſon, ſhould be one whit more capable, ſo much as Grammatically and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56523:54"/>Hiſtorically to underſtand any one ſaying of the Goſpel, than his Sheep and Oxen, which is beyond all meaſure abſurd: for then Brutes ſhould be no leſs capable of the Goſpel Doctrine than Men, and Men no more than Brutes.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, It is objected, That the Learned only are able to perceive Conſequences.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> That is moſt falſe, ſeeing not only the Learned, but alſo the unlearned have a rational diſcurſive faculty, and ſome meaſure of the uſe thereof, (except they be Diſtracted, or in meer Infancy;) and ſo, being furniſht with the Principles, are capable to diſcern their evident Conſequences, both in things Natural and Supernatural; albeit the Learned are indeed able more promptly to perceive Conſequences, and to perceive more Conſequences lying far remote from the Principles, and therefore they are ordinarily more knowing than the unlearned.</p>
                  <p>Now by the <hi>Quakers</hi> grudging of Grammar, Logick, and Philoſophy unto Miniſters of the Goſpel, and by their oppoſition to the Scripture-Rule and Scripture-Conſequence, a Man may (if he be curious) learn the Deſcription of a Miniſter of the <hi>Quakers</hi> choice, <hi>viz.</hi> He muſt neither have Grammar, Logick, nor Philoſophy, he muſt reject the Rule (at leaſt the Supremacy of the Rule) of Scripture, both Expreſs, and by good Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. That is to ſay, He muſt not know how to ſpeak Sence, nor how to Define, Divide, Judge, or Argument; he muſt abandon the Light of Nature, and throw by the Word of God, at moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but a Secondary-Rule, and a Subſervant to their Queen Regent, the Light within. That the <hi>Quakers</hi> may not think I wrong them, this Deſcription is their Principles, clearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained by me in the foregoing Queries. And will not ſuch a Man be a rare Miniſter? a worthy Meſſenger? an Interpreter among a Thouſand? he is very like to have more feet than hands, methinks.</p>

                  <head>SECT. III. <hi>Concerning Baptiſm with Water.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>Being now arrived at the main Subject of the preſent Query, which is Baptiſm, before I handle the Queſtion concerning In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſm;
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56523:55"/>I muſt here inquire, whether Baptiſm with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be an Ordinance of Divine Inſtitution under the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to continue to the end of the World; for albeit the the <hi>Quakers</hi> have here omitted it, yet it is the main and moſt proper debate concerning Baptiſm betwixt us and them, wherein the <hi>Quakers</hi> take the Negative, yea, and <hi>George Keith</hi> charges Baptiſm with Water upon us, as a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Doctrine, forſooth, in his <hi>Quakeriſm no Popery,</hi> page 100.</p>
                  <p>Wherever Baptiſm is mentioned in the New-Teſtament, and the word Water is not expreſly added, the <hi>Quakers</hi> do always deny Baptiſm with Water to be there meant, ſometimes alledging it to be meant of the Baptiſm of Doctrine; (which is, when the Word is Preached to People) ſometimes of the work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, and ſometimes of enduing with the extraordinary Gifts of the Spirit; all which are in the Scriptures Metaphorically and Improperly ſometimes called Baptiſm, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.25. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.33. <hi>Act.</hi> 1.5. And this they do, that (if ſucceſs would anſwer) they may not be forced to acknowledge Baptiſm with Water to be an Ordinance of Divine Inſtitution under the New Teſtament. We ſhall therefore, as we proceed, clear every Text that we make uſe of (where need is) from the falſe Gloſſes of the Adverſaries. This premiſed,</p>
                  <p>I Aſſert, (againſt the <hi>Quakers</hi>) that Baptiſm with Water is an Ordinance of Divine Inſtitution under the New Teſtament, and an Ordinance which (it ſhall be evident) is appointed to continue to the end of the World. I prove it;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The Baptiſm of <hi>John</hi> was an Ordinance of Divine Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment belonging to the New Teſtament: but that was with Water, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Mark</hi> 1.8. Therefore Baptiſm with Water is an Ordinance of Divine Inſtitution belonging to the New Teſtament. The Scriptures cited prove the <hi>Minor;</hi> I prove the <hi>Major:</hi> For that the Baptiſm of <hi>John</hi> was of Divine Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, is clear from <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.25. <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.30. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.33. And that it belonged to the New Teſtament appears, ſeeing <hi>John</hi> was the very firſt Miniſter of the New Teſtament way of Diſpenſation, (for which, ſee <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.12, 13. <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.16.) Together with the breaking forth whereof (and never till then) God appointed this Ordinance of Baptiſm with Water to be diſpenſed by <hi>John.</hi> Secondly, The Baptiſm with Water
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56523:55"/>diſpenſed by the Diſciples or Apoſtles of Chriſt, was an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Divine Appointment under the New Teſtament, as we ſhall preſently ſee: But the Baptiſm of <hi>John</hi> was ſubſtantially one and the ſame therewith: for their Author, or Efficient cauſe was the ſame, (by comparing <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.30. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.33. with <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.1, 2. <hi>Act.</hi> 10.48.) Their External Matter, or outward Element was the ſame, (by comparing <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.11. with <hi>Act.</hi> 10.47.) Their Internal Matter, or the thing ſignified, and their ends (and ſo alſo their Internal form, which reſults from their Inſtitution and Ends) were the ſame, (by comparing <hi>Mark</hi> 1.4. <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.3. with <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38. and 22.16.) So then they being one and the ſame as to all their cauſes, are, undeniably, the ſame Baptiſm Subſtantially; and I defie any Man to ſhew any ſubſtantial point wherein they differ; and ſo the one being an Ordinance of the New Teſtament, ſo muſt the other.</p>
                  <p>But, ſay the <hi>Quakers,</hi> (with <hi>Papiſts</hi>) The Baptiſm of <hi>John</hi> was ſubſtantially different from Chriſts Baptiſm, ſeeing <hi>John</hi> Baptized only with Water, but Chriſt Baptized with the Holy Ghoſt and with Fire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> This objection cannot prove the Baptiſm of <hi>John</hi> to be ſubſtantially different from the Baptiſm diſpenſed by Chriſts Apoſtles at his Order, ſeeing theirs ſo diſpenſed was no leſs with Water than his, and they could no more Baptize with the Holy Ghoſt and with Fire, than he. Therefore <hi>John</hi> does not there (<hi>viz. Luke</hi> 3.16.) diſtinguiſh his Baptiſm from Chriſts Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Baptiſm Adminiſtred by his Apoſtles; but he diſtinguiſhes his own Work and Office, and of all Miniſters, in Baptiſm from the Work and Office of Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> That he and other Miniſters do Adminiſter the Water and External Sign, but that its Chriſt that beſtows the inward Grace and thing ſignified.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is objected here, That theſe who were Baptized with <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſm, were again Baptized with Chriſts by <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 19.3, 4, 5. <hi>Ergo, Johns</hi> Baptiſm did ſubſtantially differ from Chriſts; or elſe, theſe would not have needed to be Baptized over again with Chriſts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Antecedent is moſt falſe: for that would depreſs the dignity of the Baptiſm wherewith Chriſt was Baptized, (being that of <hi>John</hi>) far below the dignity of that wherewith <hi>Simon
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56523:56"/>Magus</hi> was Baptized; and would infer, that Chriſt entertained a more abſolute and compleat Communion with the Church of the Old Teſtament, (all whoſe ordinary Covenant-Seals he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taked of) than with the Church of the New; and that, though he ſanctified in his own Perſon all the other ordinary Seals of both Teſtaments, yet he denied that Honour and Priviledge to his own External Baptiſm diſpenſed under the New Teſtament. Nor is the Antecedent any ways proved by that place of the <hi>Acts</hi> cited: for the ſence of that Fifth Verſe, (which is wreſted for a ground to this Objection) is not, that theſe Men were Baptized over again by <hi>Paul;</hi> but the ſence is, that after they had heard that Doctrine from <hi>John,</hi> the ſum whereof <hi>Paul</hi> repeats in the preceeding Verſe there, they were Baptized by the ſame <hi>John</hi> when he Preached it to them, and not by <hi>Paul</hi> now when he Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peats it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Apoſtles after Chriſts Aſcention, and the powring forth of the Spirit, did with great diligence and ſtudious care Baptize the New Teſtament Diſciples with Water, and were very forward in promoting that Ordinance amongſt them: Therefore Baptiſm with Water muſt, certainly, be an Ordinance of the New Teſtament Divinely Inſtituted. The Conſequence is clear, ſeeing, if it had not been an Ordinance of Divine Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution belonging to the New Teſtament, they would never have been ſo diligent and forward for promoting the Intereſt thereof in the New-Teſtament Church amongſt the Diſciples after Chriſts Aſcention, and the powring forth of the Spirit; otherwiſe they had manifeſtly betrayed their truſt in ſuch a ſtudious and diligent promoting of an Ordinance in the Church, which was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of God, and they had no Commiſſion for; which cannot be ſaid they did, and ſo much the leſs, becauſe all this paſſes on without any reproof from God, or ſhadow of alteration in them. The Conſequence being ſo clearly proved, I next prove the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent from the Apoſtles conſtant and ſpeedy diſpenſing of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm with Water to the New-Teſtament Diſciples, after the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Events, and that preſently without delay, after their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to be Diſciples, as appears from ſeveral Scripture-Texts of the New Teſtament.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, From <hi>Act.</hi> 8.36, 38. and <hi>Act.</hi> 10.47. in which two Texts, Water is ſo expreſly mentioned, that I need not prove
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:56523:56"/>it to be Baptiſm with Water that is meant, and where they were moſt ſpeedy in diſpenſing it at the firſt appearance of the parties Diſcipleſhip.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond Text is, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41. where the Diſciples were Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized aſſoon as ever their Diſcipleſhip appeared. And that this Baptiſm here is not meant of any of theſe forementioned impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called Baptiſms, and conſequently that it muſt be meant of Baptiſm with Water, which only is properly called Baptiſm, as we ſhall afterwards ſee, I prove; Becauſe the Baptiſm here mentioned pre-requires Converſion and Regeneration (<hi>ver.</hi> 38. and 41.) to the partaking thereof; and ſo it cannot be meant of the work of Converſion or Regeneration; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it ſhould pre-require it ſelf before partaking of it ſelf, that is, it ſelf without it ſelf, which is a ſtrong contradiction. Again, It pre-ſuppoſes hearing, yea receiving of the Goſpel Doctrine in ſuch Adult Perſons as theſe were, (as may be ſeen <hi>ver.</hi> 41.) which the Baptiſm of Doctrine cannot do: for that were it ſelf pre-ſuppoſed to it ſelf, and a contradiction ſtill.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, the Baptiſm here mentioned, is in the Text (<hi>ver.</hi> 38.) plainly diſtinguiſht from the miraculous Gifts of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. And moreover is enjoyned as a neceſſary ſacred Pledge of the Remiſſion of Sins, (<hi>viz.</hi> by neceſſity of precept, and when it can be had) ſuch as never were theſe Gifts of the Spirit; and ſo Baptiſm here, muſt be meant of Baptiſm with Water, or the word, Baptize, razed out of the Text.</p>
                  <p>A third Text is, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.12, 13. where theſe Diſciples were quickly Baptized after their Diſcipleſhip appeared. And neither can Baptiſm here be meant of the work of Converſion, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, ſeeing <hi>Simon Magus</hi> participated of it, who yet was no true Convert or Regenerated Perſon, as is there clear. Nor can it be meant of the Baptiſm of Doctrine; for it is there plainly declared, That they believed the things concerning the Kingdom of God and Chriſt (whether ſavingly, or meerly hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically, really, or in profeſſion only, it matters nothing to our preſent Argument) before they partaked of the Baptiſm there mentioned: but they could not believe theſe things, before they in ſome meaſure partaked of the Goſpel Doctrine, which reveals them. Nor laſtly, can it be meant of their enduing with the miraculous gifts of the Spirit, ſeeing it is there expreſly denied,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:56523:57"/>that any of theſe Baptized <hi>Samaritans</hi> were for a time after endued with theſe.</p>
                  <p>A fourth Text is, <hi>Act.</hi> 18.8. where many of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> preſently, upon their Diſcipleſhip appearing, were Baptized; and this Text can neither be meant of the Baptiſm of Doctrine, nor the work of Converſion or Regeneration, ſeeing the Baptiſm therein mentioned pre-ſuppoſes in Adult Perſons, ſuch as theſe were (we ſhall ſpeak afterwards of Infants) the hearing of the Goſpel-Doctrine, and believing: But the Baptiſm of Doctrine cannot pre-ſuppoſe the firſt of theſe; nor yet the work of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, the laſt of them; or elſe they ſhould pre-ſuppoſe themſelves to partaking of themſelves. And to mean it of enduing with the miraculous gifts of the Spirit were moſt of all impertinent, nor were theſe beſtowed upon every Believer, as the Baptiſm there mentioned is plainly imported to have been.</p>
                  <p>A fifth Text is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.13. with 17. Where the Apoſtle asks theſe <hi>Corinthians,</hi> if they were Baptized in the name of <hi>Paul?</hi> and affirms, that Chriſt ſent him not to Baptize, (that is, it was not his principal Work; for the Expreſſion is comparative) but to preach the Goſpel. Now Baptiſm here cannot be meant of the Baptiſm of Doctrine; for the Apoſtle plainly diſtinguiſhes it from that. Nor can it be meant of the work of Converſion; for then <hi>Paul</hi> denies that it was his main Errand to Convert People, which is falſe and contrary to his very Commiſſion, (<hi>Act.</hi> 26.17, 18.) and he ſhould contradict himſelf in this firſt Chapter of the Epiſtle, where he thanks God he Baptized ſo few of them, and in the fourth Chapter of this ſame Epiſtle, Verſe 15. where he affirms, that through the Goſpel he had converted ſo many of them. Nor can it be meant of enduing with the miraculous gifts of the Spirit: for the Baptiſm here mentioned is intimated to have been common to all of them, ſuch as theſe gifts were not.</p>
                  <p>The laſt Text ſhall be <hi>Act.</hi> 22.16. <hi>And now why tarrieſt thou? ariſe, and be Baptized,</hi> ſays <hi>Ananias</hi> to <hi>Paul.</hi> Now he needed not ariſe to be Converted, or to hear the Goſpel (which <hi>Ananias</hi> could Preach to him Sitting) nor yet that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Miraculous Gifts of the Spirit; albeit there was ſome neceſſity for his ariſing to be Baptized with Water, that he might go where there was Water.</p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:56523:57"/>
                  <p>Seeing then the Circumſtances of theſe Texts will not permit theſe improperly ſo called Baptiſms to be meant therein, and its certain that ſome ſort of Baptiſm is meant therein (or elſe the word, Baptize, muſt be razed out of them) It inevitably fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that Baptiſm with Water muſt be therein meant; or elſe no Baptiſm at all, which Impudence it ſelf dare not ſay, and ſo much the leſs, ſeeing the Circumſtances of theſe Texts do very well agree with the Circumſtances of Baptiſm in other Texts where the word, Water, is expreſly added. And in theſe Texts we ſee what care the Apoſtles took for the ſpeedy Adminiſtration of the Baptiſm therein mentioned to the Diſciples appearing ſuch, and to all appearing ſuch. And theſe things evidently prove our Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent of this ſecond Argument.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, our third principal Argument for proving Baptiſm with Water to be an Ordinance of Divine Inſtitution under the New Teſtament is taken from <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38. (which Text I have now proved to be meant of Baptiſm with Water) where <hi>Peter</hi> Injoyns Baptiſm with Water to all theſe New Teſtament Diſciples, as a neceſſary Sacred Symbol or Pledge (for Sacred it muſt be, in regard of its Sacred and Spiritual ſignification of a Spiritual Benefit) of the Remiſſion of Sins. For his Injoyning them to be Baptized for the Remiſſion of Sins doth plainly hold forth ſome neceſſity thereof, though not by neceſſity of Mean, yet by neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Precept.</p>
                  <p>Therefore Baptiſm with Water muſt be an Ordinance of the New Teſtament Divinely Inſtituted. For, certainly, Cancelled <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremonies (much leſs Humane inventions, or any thing not appointed of God) could never thereafter be neceſſary for Juſtification, or Remiſſion of Sins; though ſometimes they might be neceſſary for avoiding the Offence, and ſtumbling of weak brethren, as <hi>Act.</hi> 15.29. and 16.3.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, whoever under the New Teſtament hath probably received the Spirit of Grace hath a right, in the Churches Court, unto Baptiſm with Water, and ſhe is bound to admit them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: Therefore Baptiſm with Water is, ſurely, an Ordinance of the New Teſtament Divinely Inſtituted; or otherwiſe theſe could never have any Right thereunto, in her Court, nor ſhe be bound to admit them into it, without a Divine appointment making it due unto them; but, on the contrary, they ſhould be
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:56523:58"/>Bound to abſtain from it, and ſhe to Diſcharge them therefrom, as unwarrantable Will-worſhip in the Scriptures Condemned, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.20, 21, 22. Theſe things clearly prove the Conſequence. The Antecedent is proved by <hi>Peter (Act.</hi> 10.47.) where he ſays, <hi>Can any man forbid water, that theſe ſhould not be Baptized, which have received the Holy Ghoſt, as well as we?</hi> where, by the Holy Ghoſt (as often elſe where, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.5. and 8.16, 17. and 19.6.) is meaned the Miraculous Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, as is clear from the Context.</p>
                  <p>So then <hi>Peter</hi> Argues here from theſe Gifts of the Spirit beſtowed on them as a probable Evidence (though not an Infallible one. See <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.22.) of the Spirit of Grace beſtowed on them, That therefore they had a Right unto Baptiſm with Water, and no man could Debar them from it; for that were abſurd, as the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion bears, <hi>Can any man forbid,</hi> &amp;c. So then, according to the Apoſtle, a probable Evidence of the Spirit of Grace received doth immediately infer a Right, in the Churches Court (to which his Diſcourſe is here directed) unto Baptiſm Water; and ſo who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hath probably received the Spirit of Grace hath that Right, and the Church is bound to admit them to it, and they are as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd as <hi>Quakers,</hi> that would Debar them from it. Theſe things plainly prove the Antecedent.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, there is one Baptiſm mentioned <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.5. which is, certainly, an Ordinance of Divine Inſtitution, and belongs to the New Teſtament, as can never be gotten denyed: But that muſt be Baptiſm with Water, and can be no other: for when <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>There is one Baptiſm,</hi> either he means of one properly ſo called, which is Baptiſm with Water, ſeeing the ſignification of the Word <hi>[Baptize]</hi> Primarily and properly agrees unto it; or elſe he means, there is one Baptiſm Improperly and Metaphorically ſo called: but that cannot be, ſeeing there is not one, but many of theſe ſorts of Baptiſms, as we have already ſeen, whereof therefore to mean it would be a contradiction to the Text.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Baptiſm with Water is neceſſary to Salvation under the New Teſtament, <hi>viz.</hi> by neceſſity of Precept, and ſo as not the ſimple privation of it when it cannot be had, but the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of it when it may be had is Damnable: Therefore Baptiſm with Water muſt be an Ordinance of Divine Inſtitution under the New Teſtament. The Conſequence is manifeſt, ſeeing a material
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56523:58"/>piece of Divine Worſhip neceſſary to Salvation, not appointed of God, is a Will-worſhip neceſſary thereunto, which is repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Scriptures. I prove the Antecedent. The Baptiſm mentioned (<hi>Mark.</hi> 16.16.) is there made a neceſſary Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of Salvation under the New Teſtament by the plain Sentence of the Text: But the Baptiſm there mentioned is Baptiſm with Water: Therefore Baptiſm with Water is neceſſary to Salvation under the New Teſtament. The <hi>Major</hi> needs no more proving. I prove the <hi>Minor,</hi> becauſe the Baptiſm mentioned in that Text of <hi>Mark</hi> doth in adult perſons (we ſhall ſpeak afterwards of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants) pre-require Faith in Chriſt (as the Text ſhews) without which ſome way appearing by external Signs they have not a viſible Intereſt, and cannot be accompted Diſciples by the Church: but the Baptiſm of Doctrine does not pre-require that; or elſe no man might be admitted to partake of the Goſpel-Doctrine, but ſuch as before-hand probably believe; and ſo it ſhould never have been Preached to the Gentile-world. Nor does the work of Converſion pre-require Faith in Chriſt to a mans partaking of it ſelf; otherwiſe it ſhould pre-require it ſelf (without which there can be no ſuch Faith) before partaking of it ſelf, that is, it ſelf without it ſelf, which is repugnant. Nor yet can it be meant of enduing with the extraordinary Gifts of the Spirit, ſeeing theſe were never neceſſary to Salvation, as this Baptiſm mentioned in the Text is. And, I am ſure the <hi>Quakers</hi> will not ſay, that Baptiſm here is meant of the Baptiſm of the Croſs (under which they do not uſe to ſeek ſhelter) or in any other Text that we have named, ſeeing the Apoſtles, and other Miniſters of Chriſt, are the immediate Adminiſtrators of the Baptiſm mentioned here, and in all of theſe; but were not ſo of the Croſs, they had no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for that. Seeing then there is a Baptiſm meant herein <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.16. And it cannot agree with any of theſe Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called Baptiſms, but only with Baptiſm with Water, which is properly ſo called, it muſt Inevitably, be meant of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm with Water wherewith it agrees; or let the <hi>Quakers</hi> prove that it diſagrees with that too, and then, I am ſure, it ſhall agree with none at all, and we muſt raze the word <hi>[Baptize]</hi> out of the Text.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I prove the Antecedent of this Argument, from the firſt Epiſtle of <hi>Peter,</hi> 3.21. where the Apoſtle ſhews Baptiſm
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:56523:59"/>with Water to be neceſſary to Salvation under the New Teſtament, while he ſays, <hi>The like Figure whereunto, even Baptiſm, doth alſo now Save us.</hi> And that Baptiſm here is meant of Baptiſm with Water, appears by the compariſon which he uſes, comparing our Saving by Baptiſm to <hi>Noahs</hi> Saving by Water, as being, the laſt the Type, and the firſt the Anti-type (for the word which we have here turned [like Figure] is in the Original Language [<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, Anti-type.] Now there muſt be ſome near reſemblance betwixt a Type and its Anti-type, which is very little, or rather none here, betwixt <hi>Noahs</hi> Temporal Saving by Water and any of theſe Improper Baptiſms; but very great betwixt that and our Eternal Saving by Baptiſm with Water, which may be underſtood by comparing them, which we may not ſtay to do. Secondly, the explication which he ſubjoyns, in place of a Caution, ſhewing how Baptiſm now Saves us, <hi>viz.</hi> that its not by putting away the filth of the Fleſh, or by the meer external waſhing of the Body (which Water had a fitneſs to do) or by the very work wrought (as <hi>Papiſts</hi> would) but by its object which it ſignifies and Seals, <hi>viz.</hi> the Blood of Chriſt which cauſeth the Anſwer of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience towards God, will not allow it to be meant of any other Baptiſm, but Baptiſm with Water, which he ſo carefully explains; nor can any man make Sence of the explication, applying it to any of theſe Improper Baptiſms.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Chriſt gives moſt expreſs Commiſſion to his Apoſtles, and other ſucceeding Miniſters of the New Teſtament (for the Apoſtles were not to live to the worlds end, which is the duration of the Commiſſion) to Baptize with Water all the Diſciples that ſhould come unto him under the New Teſtament to the end of the world. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20. Therefore Baptiſm with water muſt, uncontrolably, be an Ordinance of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Divinely Inſtituted, and to continue to the end of the world. The Conſequence hereof is beyond the exception of all the world. The Antecedent will alſo be clear, if I can but prove, that by Baptiſm here is meant Baptiſm with Water, which if I do not (good Reader) I Intreat thee believe me not henceforth.</p>
                  <p>Therefore firſt, the Baptiſm here mentioned in this Text of <hi>Matthew</hi> pre-requires Diſcipleſhip in the party to be Baptized (for the Words in the Original Language are, <hi>Go make Diſciples all Nations, Baptizing them, &amp;c.</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>). But the Baptiſm
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56523:59"/>of Doctrine does not pre-require that; or elſe a man might not Preach the Goſpel to any that is not beforehand a Diſciple; and ſo it ſhould never have been Preached to the Gentile, or Heathen world. Nor does Converſion pre-require Diſcipleſhip; or elſe no man might indeavour the Converſion of an <hi>Heathen,</hi> or <hi>Pagan,</hi> or of any man who is not before-hand a Diſciple. Nor can the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Gifts of the Spirit be here underſtood by Baptiſm, ſeeing the Baptiſm here mentioned is to continue to the end of the world, which theſe Gifts were not, as no man, even a <hi>Quaker,</hi> will deny. Therefore, ſeeing none of theſe Improper Baptiſms are here meant, and ſome Baptiſm is meant, it muſt be meant of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm with water, ſeeing the Text cannot agree with any other.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Baptiſm mentioned here in <hi>Matthew,</hi> is the ſame with that mentioned in <hi>Mark (Mark.</hi> 16.16.) ſeeing <hi>Matthew</hi> here, and <hi>Mark</hi> there are manifeſtly giving a Narration of the ſelf-ſame thing, and Commiſſion, as needs no proof: But that Baptiſm mentioned in <hi>Mark</hi> is Baptiſm with Water, as is before proved: Therefore ſo alſo is this mentioned here in <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> ſeeing they are the very ſame, as ſaid is.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the whole Tenor and Circumſtances of the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for Baptiſm in this Text of <hi>Matthew</hi> do agree with the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm with Water thereafter diſpenſed by the Apoſtles, and other Miniſters in their times, at their Order, and can agree with no other: Therefore the ſame muſt be here meant, and no other. The Conſequence is ſo eaſie that, except we reſolve utterly to abandon and renounce our Reaſon, and turn abſolute Brutes, we muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand every Saying of that wherewith it agrees, and not of that wherewith it diſagrees. I prove the Antecedent. For this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion in <hi>Matthew</hi> for Baptiſm pre-requires the Diſcipleſhip of the Party [<hi>Go make Diſciples, Baptizing,</hi> &amp;c.] or it requires that they firſt be made Diſciples before they be Baptized, or none to be Baptized but Diſciples, as is moſt clear. 2dly. It requires them to Baptize all the Diſciples of whatſoever Nation (if they appear to be ſuch <hi>viz.</hi>) as the Connexion of this Baptiſm with the Condition required, whereupon it is to be diſpenſed, declares; and the Relative word <hi>[Them]</hi> not being reſtricted with any limitating Circumſtance, does ſtill repeat its whole Antecedent, and is of the ſame full extent therewith. 3dly. It requires them without delay, with the firſt convenience after the appearing of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:56523:60"/>their Diſcipleſhip to Baptize them, <hi>[Go make them Diſciples, Baptizing]</hi> as if it ſhould inſtantly be done, there being no more now to be waited for, after diſcovery of the condition; and by this all needleſs delays are cut off. And laſtly, It requires the Baptiſm therein mentioned, to be diſpenſed in the Name of the Lord, as is plainly expreſt in the Text. Theſe things expreſs the tenor and circumſtances of this Commiſſion, ſuch as are any ways Intrinſecal. Now all theſe things do plainly agree unto the Baptiſm with Water, thereafter diſpenſed by the foreſaid Perſons, and (as is already proved) cannot agree with any other. That they agree unto that, I prove; for the Baptiſm with Water diſpenſed by them, pre-required Diſcipleſhip, or it was diſpenſed to none but Diſciples. Secondly, It was diſpenſed to all that became Diſciples, (and appeared ſuch to the Church) of whatever Nation. Thirdly, It was without delay diſpenſed to them, upon the appearing of their Diſcipleſhip. Fourthly, It was diſpenſed to them in the Name of the Lord. All which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from our ſecond, third, and fourth Arguments before, and the many Scriptures cited therein. See <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41. and 8.12, 13, 36, 37. and 10.47. and 18.8. and 22.16. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.13.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, All the Baptiſms, except Baptiſm with Water, that can be alledged or pretended to be meant in this Text of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> (as the Baptiſm of Doctrine, of Converſion, of the miraculous Gifts of the Spirit, and let the Baptiſm of the Croſs be added too) are only Improperly and Metaphorically ſo called, as needs little demonſtration, (I think) ſeeing pouring, dipping, ſprinkling, and waſhing (which the word, Baptize, ſignifies in the Original Language, being <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) cannot be proper to any of theſe, and to that any of them agreeth in a proper ſence, as any Man, without preſerves, may ſee. Having premiſed this ground, I again prove, that the Baptiſm mentioned in this Text of <hi>Matthew,</hi> and in all the Texts that I have named, (which here I advertiſe, that this evident Argument may be cumula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively applied to every one of them) is Baptiſm with Water; Becauſe we may not throw about the words of any Text of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from a proper to an improper meaning, except ſome ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, either of the Analogy of Faith in general, (which is the conſtant and perpetual ſentence of many perſpicuous and bright
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:56523:60"/>ſhining Scriptures concerning things eſſential to Salvation;) or elſe of the particular ſcope and circumſtances of the Context it ſelf, conſtrain us ſo to do; otherwiſe we may, without any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity conſtraining us, at our alone will and meer pleaſure, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other ground imaginable moving us, throw about from a proper to an improper meaning, the moſt properly meant ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all the whole Scriptures, and reject the proper ſence and meaning of every Text, and make them every where at our meer pleaſure, to ſpeak improperly: but that is utterly abſurd, and would enervat and turn to nothing the very body of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as needs no Demonſtration, I am ſure: but there is no ſuch neceſſity in this or any Text we have Argued from, to throw about the word, Baptiſm, from being meant properly of Baptiſm with Water, to be meant of any of the fore-mentioned improperly ſo called Baptiſms; Or elſe, we charge the <hi>Quakers</hi> to ſhew and make good that neceſſity, (if they can) which we defie them and a whole Legion of their Inſpirers ever to do. Therefore, by this irrefragable Argument from the Analogy of Faith, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm with Water (which alone is properly ſo called) is both meant here in <hi>Matthew,</hi> and in all the Texts that we have named. <hi>Analogum per ſe poſitum ſtat pro principali Analogato.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having ſo demonſtrated, that Baptiſm with Water is meant in that Text of <hi>Matthew;</hi> hence it is manifeſt, that Baptiſm with Water is an Ordinance which God hath appointed to be continued to the end of the World; for the promiſe there ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned of Chriſts preſence with his Miniſters there Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated alway even unto the end of the World, for their encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Execution of that their Commiſſion, doth moſt plainly ſhew their Commiſſion to be of that continuance. Secondly, I have ſhewed, that Baptiſm with Water was once in the New Teſtament Church neceſſary unto Salvation, (as was explained) and due in the Churches Court, to all who probably had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Spirit of Grace. Let the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſhew us, (if they can) when it became unneceſſary, and when, or where that Bond and Tie was taken off the New Teſtament Church. Thirdly, ſeeing by all our preceeding Arguments, it is evident that Baptiſm with Water was once of Divine Inſtitution under the New Teſtament, the <hi>Quakers</hi> muſt either yield the continuance thereof to be to the end of the World; or elſe, they muſt ſay, That it is ſince
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:56523:61"/>the Inſtitution repealed again. Let them ſhew us then, where the repealing thereof is Recorded, or to be found in the Scriptures, which are the Supream Rule of Faith and Manners; for the <hi>Quakers</hi> bare word (ſpoken (may be) in a mixture when the Moon was at the Full) is not enough for it. And if they can ſhew us nothing for it, (which is ſure) and yet will ſay, It is repealed, they may upon the ſame ground, (that is to ſay, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ground) ſay, that the Commandments to repent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, fear, and love God, and all the reſt of them, are repealed, and then we may do what we pleaſe, and follow the Light within at the top-ſpeed.</p>
                  <p>But now, becauſe in Juſtice we are bound to give the <hi>Quakers</hi> fair Game, we muſt hear what they have to ſay againſt our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Doctrine; and we need not doubt, but their Infallible heads are furniſht with forcible Arguments.</p>
                  <p>Therefore firſt, becauſe from thence they fear their greateſt danger, (albeit I have proved the buſineſs by many other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Arguments, and could without that Argument irreſiſtibly make good the point) they aſſault the Argument from <hi>Matthew</hi> with ſeveral devices.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, They alledge that Baptizing in that Text is the ſame with Diſciple-making, which is not meant of Baptizing with Water; and ſo neither is that.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ,</hi> Firſt, They ought to ſhew us ſome neceſſary ground for this Metaphorical Commentary upon the word, Baptize, which we have not ſeen as yet. Secondly, Unto this conceipt we ſhall oppoſe our ſecond and laſt Arguments, whereby it is proved, that Baptiſm with Water is meant in the Text, in deſpight of this Exception. Conſider the Arguments; for we need not repeat them. Thirdly, All their grounds for this Exception is, becauſe when it is ſaid, <hi>Go make Diſciples, &amp;c.</hi> the word, Baptize, is ſubjoined in the Preſent Tence of the Participle, Baptizing: but by this ground (if good) Teaching, which preſently follows too, and in the ſame manner, ſhall alſo be the ſame with Diſciple-making; and ſo the whole Commiſſion ſhall conſiſt of one and the ſame thing thrice repeated; which is moſt abſurd, and no Man, though as abſurd as a <hi>Quaker,</hi> will ſay it. For, who ſhall think, or why, that Chriſt commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſuch a three-fold Tautology in delivering ſo ſhort a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion? that would neither have ſuited the wiſdom of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, nor the nature of the thing.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, They except againſt the ſame Text, (with their old Friend <hi>Socinus</hi>) that the Apoſtles diſpenſed their Baptiſm with Water only in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, whereas the Baptiſm mentioned in this Text of <hi>Matthew</hi> is to be diſpenſed in the Name of Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt; and ſo they cannot be one and the ſame.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> By this Argument they might as well prove, that <hi>Paul</hi> Preached not in the Name of any other Perſon of the Trinity, but of the Lord Jeſus only, becauſe he only is mentioned, (<hi>Act.</hi> 9.27, 29.) or that he and <hi>Timothy</hi> ſerved no other Perſon of the Trinity, becauſe he only is mentioned, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.1. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, I ſhall oppoſe unto this Exception my firſt, ſecond, and fourth Arguments, whereby, maugre this exception, Baptiſm with Water is proved to be meant in this Text of <hi>Matthew.</hi> Thirdly, The reſt of the Trinity are omitted in the Hiſtory, (though it follows not, that ſo they were in the action) partly for ſhorten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Narration, (which is uſual) and partly becauſe, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great doubt and controverſie of the time, <hi>If Jeſus was the true Meſſias;</hi> for that cauſe his name is more frequently mentioned, than the reſt of the Trinity, in the whole New Teſtament.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They except againſt the ſame Text, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles are therein commanded to Baptize in the Name of the Lord, which ſort of Baptizing is with the Spirit, (ſay they) not at all with Water.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Unto this Exception I ſhall firſt oppoſe all my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whereby, over the belly thereof, I have proved Baptiſm with Water to be meant in the Text. Secondly, Was not Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm with Water (ſay ye) diſpenſed in the Name of the Lord? See it done, (I pray) and commanded to be done, that ye may not pretend ignorance hereafter, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38. and 8.16. and 10.48. Laſtly, It muſt be a deſperate cauſe that forces it's Patrons to ſuch contrary defences; preſently they affirmed, that Baptiſm with Water was diſpenſed in the Name of the Lord; now they cry, About Ship, and deny that Baptiſm in the Name of the Lord is Baptiſm with Water. Are not theſe Men indeed in a mixture, who in the unjuſt defence of falſhood thus run upon ſuch deſperate. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 word">

                  <p>But fourthly, They except againſt the ſame Text, that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm with Water cannot be meant therein, becauſe the Apoſtles (ſay they) had no commiſſion to Baptize with Water, ſeeing <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.17.) that Chriſt ſent him not to Baptize, but to Preach the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> But in deſpight of this Exception, all our forementioned Arguments do plainly prove the Baptiſm mentioned in the Text to be Baptiſm with Water, and ſo alſo that the Apoſtles had a Commiſſion to Baptize with Water. Secondly, The <hi>Quakers</hi> are bound by this their reaſoning to acknowledge the Baptiſm there mentioned, (<hi>viz.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.17.) to be Baptiſm with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, (or elſe they will loſe the whole ground pretended for their exception) which acknowledged, (as we have alſo before proved it truly to be) it preſently appears from the Context of the ſame place, that the Apoſtles had a Commiſſion for Baptizing with Water, ſeeing <hi>Paul</hi> plainly there declares, that he Baptized ſome of theſe <hi>Corinthians,</hi> which (doubtleſs) he did not without Commiſſion; or elſe, he had been a manifeſt Intruder and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurper of an Office in the Church and Worſhip of God, for which he had no Order, or Warrant, which muſt be falſe. I anſwer therefore laſtly, that the meaning of theſe words of <hi>Paul</hi> is plainly Comparative, <hi>viz.</hi> that Baptiſm was not the principal and chief work that he was ſent for, but the Preaching of the Goſpel; ſuch as is the meaning of that expreſſion, (<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.6.) <hi>I deſired Mercy, and not Sacrifice:</hi> and ſuch as is the meaning of that, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 15.22.) <hi>If I had not come and ſpoken unto them, they had not had ſin,</hi> that is, nothing compared to what they now have.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, They except againſt the ſame Text, that Baptiſm with Water cannot be meant therein, becauſe (ſay they) it is not therein expreſly mentioned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, A Man might upon this ground much rather argue againſt Chriſts demonſtration, (<hi>Luk.</hi> 20.37.) that the riſing of the dead is not expreſly taught, (<hi>Exod.</hi> 3.6. from whence he brings his Argument) where God ſays, <hi>I am the God of Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob;</hi> and that therefore ſuch a thing cannot be there meant. Or that Circum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſion of the fleſh of the Foreskin is not expreſly mentioned under every diſtinguiſhing Character thereof, (<hi>Galat.</hi> 5.2, 3.) where the fleſh of the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:56523:62"/>Foreskin is omitted; and that therefore it cannot be that which is there meant, but our Spiritual Circumciſion in Chriſt, that is, our Regeneration, muſt be the thing which <hi>Paul</hi> there diſputes againſt and condemns: and is not that well argued? Secondly, As Baptiſm with Water is not here expreſly named, in reſpect of every punctilio of its deſignation; So far leſs is any of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned improper Baptiſms here expreſly mentioned, ſeeing the name Baptiſm, is proper to that of Water, and not to the other: Therefore, by the <hi>Quakers</hi> own Rule, none of theſe is meant here either; and ſo (if the Rule be good) no ſort of Baptiſm is here meant, but the word <hi>Baptizing,</hi> is ſet down here for an impertinent Cipher ſignifying nothing. Thirdly, I have ſhewed before, that there is much Doctrine meant in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which is not therein expreſly taught, but implicitly only; and ſo this Rule of the <hi>Quakers</hi> is moſt falſe. I anſwer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore laſtly, that albeit the word <hi>Water,</hi> be not here (<hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19.) formally expreſt; yet the circumſtances of the Text, the Analogy of Faith, and other Scriptures that I have compared it with in my Arguments, do manifeſtly and irreſiſtibly demonſtrate the Baptiſm here mentioned, to be Baptiſm with Water. Let the <hi>Quakers</hi> anſwer my Arguments if they can, I mean at the <hi>Greek</hi> Calends.</p>
                  <p>All the particular exceptions of the <hi>Quakers</hi> againſt our Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from that Text of <hi>Matthew,</hi> being ſo overthrown and anſwered; The <hi>Quakers</hi> have as yet one general Argument, whereby they hope to overturn Baptiſm with Water, <hi>viz.</hi> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm with Water (ſay they) was but a figure, that Chriſt might be made manifeſt to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who had diverſe Baptiſms impoſed on them, till the time of Reformation; but Chriſt the Subſtance being come, the ſhadows muſt flee away. This Objection they lay down in their <hi>Confeſſion of Faith, page</hi> 25.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Whether Baptiſm with Water be a Figure, or not, I have now abundantly proved it to be an Ordinance of the New Teſtament, Divinely Appointed, due in the Churches Court to all the viſible, or appearing Diſciples of the New Teſtament, and neceſſary to Salvation under the ſame, and to continue to the end of the World. And what then dare the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſay againſt it? Or, how dare they oppoſe their own meer Brain-ſick fancies to the Word of God and Dictates of the Holy Ghoſt?
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:56523:63"/>Secondly, Let Baptiſm with Water be a Figure manifeſting Chriſt to <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> too, (that is to ſay, a ſacred Symbol of Chriſts blood ſhed (not to be ſhed, and ſo not a ſhadow of a thing to come) on the Croſs, and a Seal of Remiſſion of Sins there through;) Yet Chriſt, by his Incarnation, Death, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection did not cancel all manner of Figures univerſally, ſeeing the Bow in the Cloud is ſtill a Figure to us, or a Symbol and Pledge rather, that God will no more deſtroy the World by Water, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 9.11, 12, 13.) Nor did he thereby cancel all manner of Figures, (I would rather call them ſacred Signs and Symbols, if the <hi>Quakers</hi> would too) repreſenting Chriſt and his Paſſion and Blood Shed; (for we ſhall moreover prove at the Survey of their next enſuing Query, that Chriſt hath Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Bread and Wine to be in the Euchariſt a Sacred Sign and Symbol of his Body and Blood to the Worlds end.) But he hath only cancelled thereby Old Teſtament Figures, ſhadowing forth Him, and His Death and Paſſion to come. Thirdly, If Baptiſm with Water was only a Figure to manifeſt unto <hi>Iſrael</hi> Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, why then did the Apoſtles diſpenſe it afterwards to the whole Diſciples of the Gentile Church, without ever caſhiering it, and with ſo much ſpeed and diligence after the appearing of their Diſcipleſhip? Laſtly, Goſpel Baptiſm, which is done with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as the External Symbol, is ſo far from being a ſhadow that ſhould have fled away, when Chriſt came in the Fleſh and Dyed, and the time of Reformation was come, that, on the direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it then firſt received its Inſtitution after Chriſt was come, and together with the breaking forth of that Reformation, (<hi>viz.</hi> the New Teſtament way of Diſpenſation) and is by Chriſt put into the Commiſſion of the Miniſters of that Reformation, as an Ordinance to be continued to the Worlds end, and was thereafter accordingly carried along therewith, as a Sacred Symbol due to all the viſible Diſciples; all which we have before proved. The paſſage of Scripture here cited by the <hi>Quakers</hi> out of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> (<hi>Heb.</hi> 9.10.) will not help their Erroneous Cauſe: for the Apoſtle does not there ſpeak of the Goſpel-Baptiſm for the evident grounds now given, and as is clear from the Context it ſelf, (where he ſpeaks of Old Teſtament Ordinances only) nor was that impoſed on the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in Old Teſtament times, but began with the New: But the Baptiſms he there
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56523:63"/>ſpeaks of, are the legal waſhings and purifications that were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the time of the Old Teſtament, ſuch as are deſcribed in <hi>Numb.</hi> 19. <hi>Chap. Levit.</hi> 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. <hi>Chapters.</hi>

                  </head>
                  <p>Being now come to Infant-Baptiſm, upon which, I am ſure, I ſhall need to ſay very little, in regard that Reverend and Worthy Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath in his Book againſt <hi>Tombs,</hi> ſo fully and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently diſcuſſed the Point, that I can hardly expect that ever any Man ſhall add to him; but only becauſe this may come into the hands of ſome Perſons who have not ſeen that, Therefore (though very briefly) I ſhall not altogether ſeem to ſay nothing, but ſtill referring the Reader to the foreſaid excellent Book.</p>
                  <p>The Queſtion therefore is, Whether the Infants of Believing Parents, or Profeſſing to believe, (which is all one to the Church) ought to be Baptized, or not? Whereunto I anſwer affirmatively, that they ought be Baptized. I prove it. But firſt I muſt Premiſe, that the Covenant is the ſame in Subſtance under the Old Teſtament and the New. For which ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11, 12, 13. and 11.17, 24. <hi>Galat.</hi> 3.8, 9. and 4.28. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. from <hi>Ver.</hi> 12. to the end.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I muſt Premiſe, That the Children of Believers have the ſame Intereſt into the Covenant with the Parents: for which ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. <hi>ch. Act.</hi> 2.39. <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.14. <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.16. and for that cauſe <hi>Paul</hi> calls the Children of Believers Holy, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14) <hi>viz.</hi> Externally, Federally, and in regard of Church-Memberſhip, and not becauſe they were not Baſtards, (for ſo the Children of meer <hi>Pagans</hi> might as well have been called Holy) but becauſe they were deſcended of Believing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents (though but on the one ſide) which is the very reaſon that he gives in the Text, why they are Holy.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I muſt premiſe, that Circumciſion was the initiat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Seal under the Old Teſtament, which is evident by the early Adminiſtration thereof upon the Eight Day, and that by Divine Appointment, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. Having premiſed theſe things, I prove my Concluſion.</p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:56523:64"/>
                  <p>Firſt, Children of Believers were by a Divine Right Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed under the Old Teſtament: but Baptiſm under the New Teſtament is ſucceeded in the room of Circumciſion under the Old: Therefore the Children of Believers ought to be Baptized under the New Teſtament. Only that needs proving, that Baptiſm under the New Teſtament is ſucceeded in the room of Circumciſion under the Old: which I prove, Firſt, becauſe they both Seal the very ſame thing; and Secondly, becauſe as Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion was the initiating Seal under the Old Teſtament, ſo is Baptiſm under the New. That they both Seal the ſame thing is clear by comparing <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. with <hi>Mark.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38. where Circumciſion is declared to be a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith, and Baptiſm is held forth to be a Symbol, or Pledge of the Remiſſion of Sins: now the Imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs is really one and the ſame thing with Remiſſion of Sins (as alſo may be ſeen <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.6, 7, 8.) albeit the reſpects be divers. And again, as Circumciſion under the Old Teſtament was a Symbol of inward Mortification and Repentance, ſo is Baptiſm under the New, for which compare <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.16. and 30.6. and <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.4. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.28, 29. with <hi>Mark.</hi> 1.4. and <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38. and 19.4. from all which it is clear that Baptiſm is a Symbol and Seal of the ſame things whereof Circumciſion was.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that as Circumciſion was the Initiating Seal under the Old Teſtament, ſo is Baptiſm under the New. I prove, Firſt, becauſe the Apoſtles Diſpenſed it ſo early to the Diſciples at the firſt appearing of their New Breath and Intereſt into the Covenant, as we ſhewed before. Secondly, becauſe by Baptiſm we are ſaid to put on Chriſt. <hi>Galat.</hi> 3.7.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Lords Supper (which I ſhall prove to be of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſtitution at the Survey of their next Query) is a Symbol or Seal of our Growth and Nouriſhment into the Covenant: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Baptiſm, which is the other Seal, muſt be the Seal of our New Birth and Entry into the Covenant. For it were abſurd to ſay, we had two ſorts of Seals for our Growth and Confirmation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and our Birth and Entry into the Covenant left altogether without Seal: nay we have much more need to be Confirmed concerning this, than that; and ſo it ought far rather to be Sealed.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall add, as the Epilogue of this Argument, that the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:56523:64"/>Apoſtle Teaches (<hi>Celoſ.</hi> 2.11, 12.) that our Burial with Chriſt in Baptiſm is our Circumciſion in Chriſt, which ſhews that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is ſucceeded to us in the Room of Circumciſion.</p>
                  <p>But the Anti-pedobaptiſts except againſt the Argument, that Baptiſm is not ſucceeded in the Room of Circumciſion, becauſe Circumciſion was Diſpenſed to none but Males, and on the eighth day exactly, and becauſe Circumciſion was not a Figure of Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> But our preceeding Arguments prove that Baptiſm is ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in the Room thereof, ſeeing it exactly acts the Part and Office that Circumciſion formally acted as the Initiating Seal, which ſhews it to be come in the Room and place thereof.</p>
                  <p>As for that, that Baptiſm is not Tyed to the Circumſtance of the eighth day, as Circumciſion was, that ſays nothing; for albeit Baptiſm be ſucceeded in the Room of Circumciſion in the ſubſtance of its work, yet it does not therefore follow that it ſhould ſucceed to the external Circumſtances of Circumciſion: for ſo, not Baptiſm, but the Circumſtances thereof ſhould have ſucceeded to the Circumſtances of Circumciſion, which is not the Queſtion, nor any thing we plead for. Again, Circumciſion in the Inſtitution was reſtricted to the eighth day, which Baptiſm is not, and ſo it is not Tyed to that Circumſtance.</p>
                  <p>That Circumciſion was Diſpenſed only to Males ſays, nothing neither, ſeeing women by Nature were not capable thereof; and therefore it ſtood in the Room thereof to them to be the Daughters of Circumciſed Fathers. But they are capable of Baptiſm, and are not excepted from it, as they were from Circumciſion; but, on the contrary, women are Baptized, as well as men. <hi>Act.</hi> 8.12. and 16.15.</p>
                  <p>For that, that in the matter of Succeſſion they require the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to be a Figure of the Succeſſor, I believe it is ſpoken in Jeſt; otherwiſe they will have every Cedent a Figure of his Aſſigny, and every Servant removing at the Term to be a Figure of the other that comes in his place, which is Ridiculous.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, whoſoever is Adopted and received within the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, hath a Divine right unto Baptiſm under the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but Children of believing Parents are by God Adopted and received within the Covenant, as is plain from <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. ch. <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.14. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.39. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. Therefore Children of believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56523:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>Parents have a Divine right unto Baptiſm under the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The <hi>Minor</hi> is Evident by the Scriptures Cited. I prove the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor,</hi> becauſe Baptiſm under the New Teſtament is the Initiating Seal and Symbol belonging and appended to our Entry and Reception into the Covenant (as was before proved) under the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and ſo it belongs to every perſon that is received into the Covenant upon the accompt of their Reception; or elſe it ſhall belong to their Entry and Reception (as is ſuppoſed and above proved) and yet not to them as Entered and Received, which involves a manifeſt Contradiction.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, all who are probably Partakers of the Spirit of Grace and Regeneration have a Divine Right under the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto Baptiſm, in the Churches Court, and ſhe ought to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them thereunto, as was before proved from <hi>Act.</hi> 10.47, 48. But the Children of believing Parents are probably Partakers of the Spirit of Grace and Regeneration under the New Teſtament: Therefore they have a right unto Baptiſm, in the Churches Court, and ſhe is bound to admit them thereunto. The <hi>Major</hi> was evidently proved before. I prove the <hi>Minor;</hi> for Gods taking them in within the Covenant (<hi>Gen.</hi> 17. chap.) makes it probable. His promiſing to Circumciſe the hearts of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as well as the Parents (<hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6.) makes it probable. Gods Sanctifying ſome of the Children of believers from the Womb (<hi>Jerem.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.15.) makes it probable. <hi>Pauls</hi> calling them Holy (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14.) <hi>viz.</hi> federally and externally, makes it probable. And if it were not probable that the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Believers did partake of the Spirit of Grace and Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, then it could not be probable that any of them Dying in Non-age ſhould be Saved, ſeeing none but ſuch as are Born of Water and of the Spirit can enter into the Kingdom of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5. And laſtly (for, I am ſure, I need no more) Chriſts declaring and aſſerting their Intereſt into the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven (<hi>Mat.</hi> 19.14. <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.16.) whereunto they cannot enter without being Regenerated, makes it probable.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things make it Infallibly certain as to the Kind, or <hi>Quoad Speciem,</hi> and probable as to particular perſons, or <hi>Quoad Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidua.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But againſt this Laſt the <hi>Quakers</hi> except (with the <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>

This would have been ſo bad a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, that it would have bereft the Diſcourſe of all Sence. Secondly, hereby they ſhew that, in their opinion, there are no Infants that have Intereſt into the Kingdom of Heaven; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they ſhould have granted Chriſts words in reſpect of Infants properly ſo called; and then farewel to the Objection. Thirdly, we here appeal the Analogy of Faith, without ſome neceſſity from which, the words muſt not be detorted from a proper to an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper Sence.</p>
                  <p>Secondly they except, that theſe were not young Infants that were brought to Chriſt, but grown to ſome pretty Age, becauſe Chriſt ſays, <hi>Suffer them to come,</hi> intimating that they themſelves could Walk.</p>

                  <p>Fourthly, all the viſible, or appearing Diſciples of Chriſt ought to be Baptized under the New Teſtament, as is evident from <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19.

                  <p>The <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> uſe to urge this Text of <hi>Matthew</hi> againſt Infant-Baptiſm, reading the words as they are in our Tranſlation, <hi>Go ye therefore, and Teach all Nations, Baptizing them, &amp;c.</hi> From whence they Infer that all that are to be Baptized ought firſt to be Taught, whereof Children are not capable; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought not to be Baptized. But, beſide that the <hi>Jews</hi> Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were admitted to the Initiating Seal, who were as uncapable of Teaching as ours, The truth is, the word in the Original Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which follows in the beginning of the very next Verſe, and in the Native Ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mology ſignifies to Teach; and ſo this Text is ſo far from favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Error, that it clearly overthrows it, as we have now ſhewed.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> ſtill object, that Chriſt, after he had Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Apoſtles and Miniſters to go and Preach the Goſpel to all the world, adds, that he that believes, and is Baptized ſhall be Saved, <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.16. Therefore Chriſt pre-requires Faith unto Baptiſm: but Children cannot believe, therefore they ought not to be Baptized. Some anſwer to the <hi>Minor</hi> of this Argument, that, though Children cannot actually believe, yet they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the Seeds and Principles of Faith, or of a Seminal and Inclinative Faith; which I grant is true, but ſeeing the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment urges actual Faith (which they have not adverted to) it belongs not to the anſwer thereof.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer therefore, and grant that actual believing is pre-required unto Baptiſm in adult perſons come to ſome years of diſcretion (according to theſe Scriptures, <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.16. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38. and 8.12, 13. and 18.8.) and therefore they muſt give a ſerious Profeſſion thereof, or ſome probable Evidence thereof muſt be had before the Church admit them to Baptiſm, ſeeing (as is ſuppoſed) they are either before, Strangers unto the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; or elſe, if that be not, yet, if they refuſe the Goſpel-offer, they fore-fault their Intereſt; and ſo without the Profeſſion of their Faith, or ſome probable evidence thereof, they have not a viſible Intereſt. But theſe things are not pre-required of the Children of believing Parents, who have an Intereſt (not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faulted by any refuſal) upon the accompt of their deſcent from Chriſtian Parents Profeſſing the Faith, whoſe Children are with themſelves taken in within the Covenant (as is before ſhewed) and it ſtands in the room of a Profeſſion to them, that they are by God taken in within the Covenant, and born within the Church of Chriſtian Parents profeſſing the Faith. All which is ſtill further clear in the Circumciſion of the <hi>Jews</hi> Children, nor can any thing be ſaid againſt the one which does not with equal force aſſault the other.</p>
                  <p>Again they object, that Baptiſm is a perfect Ordinance; and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:56523:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>that therefore it ought to be Diſpenſed to none but Folk that are perfect, ſuch as Children are not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> If this Conſequence of the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> be but good, we muſt ſend all Gods Ordinances away to Heaven, ſeeing there are no perfect Folk upon Earth, as ſhall be made appear afterwards; and by the ſame Argument none but perfect Folk ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to any Ordinance of God, and then (I'le warrant) the Churches ſhall be Scant enough. But how can Baptiſm which Seals to us the Remiſſion of our Sins require us to be before-hand perfect, and ſo have no Sin to be Remitted? But they urge, that, Baptiſm being a perfect Ordinance, does at leaſt require ſuch as are capable of perfection, which Children are not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Our perfection is not abſolved in the very Inſtant of our Baptiſm, but is carried on by degrees while we live in this world, and not abſolved till we go hence to the other world; Therefore Baptiſm does not require that we be capable to be perfected that very Inſtant of its Adminiſtration to us: for it will be enough if we by degrees become capable of perfection, according as by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees our perfection is to be carried on. This diſtinguiſhes the <hi>Major,</hi> which I poſitively have denyed, and they could never have proved with all <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Leidens</hi> Logick. Again, Perfection is oppoſed either to a Negative Imperfection, which is the want of any thing, which if we had it, we would be the more perfect, but it is not competent to us, nor is it our fault to want it; and this ſort of Imperfection all Creatures muſt be content to be for ever liable unto, and they ſhall never be perfect in the Sence of Perfection oppoſite to this kind of Imperfection; and ſo Perfection in this Sence cannot be pre-required to Baptiſm, ſeeing it will not be required to Heaven it ſelf. Or Secondly, Perfection is oppoſed to a Privative and Culpable Imperfection, which is the want of a thing that by the Law we are obliged to have, and it is our fault to want it; and of Perfection oppoſite to this kind of Imperfection Infants are capable, as well as adult perſons, ſeeing if <hi>Adam</hi> had ſtood in his Obedience, there had been no Privative, or Culpable Imperfection in any of his Children how young ſoever, more than in himſelf, which, if Infants were not capable of the Perfection we now ſpeak of, as well as adult perſons, could not have been. Any that would ſee Infant-Baptiſm more largely and accurately handled, I refer them to that fore-named Excellent piece of Learned

                  <hi>Whether doth the Scriptures ſay in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that, Eating of Bread, and Drinking of Wine, after Supper, was an Ordinance of Chriſt? and whether do ye Practice this as Chriſt and his Apoſtles did after Supper?

And Chriſt ſays, as oft as ye Eat of this Bread, and Drink of this Wine,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Is that a ſtanding Command? or is it left to people? Seeing its ſaid, as oft as ye Eat this and Drink this, do it in Remembrance of his Death, and ſhewing his Death till he come again. Was this coming to the end of the world? or was it until his coming to Dwell in his Apoſtles, who ſaid he would come and Dwell and walk in them? need they then Bread and Wine to put them in Remembrance of him? and doth not Chriſt ſay, Eat this, and Drink this in Remembrance of his Death? and doth not the Apoſtle ſay, that they muſt Die with Chriſt? and to Die with him is to come to the Death with him. And they that be in the Death of Chriſt, and Die with Chriſt, muſt they have Bread and Wine to put them in Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his Death? Yea, or Nay? and doth not the Apoſtle ſay, that they muſt Die with Chriſt, and be Buried with him? and when the people are Dead and Buried with Chriſt, muſt they have Bread and Wine to put them in Remembrance of Chriſts Death?

And is not Bread and Wine from below? and if the Apoſtle puts them to ſeek theſe things that are above, then he brought them off theſe things that are below; for he ſays to the</hi> Corinthians, The things that are ſeen are Temporal, but the things that are not ſeen are Eternal. <hi>This he Spoke when they were Jangling and in a Diſorder about outward things. Doth he not bring them off things that are Seen to things that are not ſeen? and whether or not ye ever intend, ye your ſelves called Miniſters, or your Hearers ſhall come any nearer to Chriſts Death, and Die, and be Buried with him, but only to take Bread and Wine in Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Chriſts Death, leſt ye and they ſhould come to forget Chriſts Death?

                  <p>Their Doctrine here doth very well agree with <hi>George Keiths Quakeriſm no Popery, (page</hi> 100.) where he flatly denies the Supper of the Lord to be any ſtanding Ordinance of Chriſt, and will have it (forſooth) a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Principle and Practice: as alſo with their Heretical <hi>Confeſſion of Faith,</hi> wherein they deny all manner of External Ordinances, <hi>pages</hi> 24, 25, 26, 27, 77, 78, 79, 92, 93, 102, 103, 104, 105, 122, 130, 133, 135.</p>
                  <p>Before we come to a particular Diſquiſition upon this Query, we muſt expunge that reſtrictive Clauſe <hi>[After Supper]</hi> out of the principal Queſtion which is firſt in order, as not being any part of the Sacrament Inſtituted having any myſtical mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, neither being any where of Scripture commanded, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only an External Circumſtance of that firſt Supper of our Lord meerly occaſional, becauſe of the Paſſover taken before it, which according to its Inſtitution (<hi>Exod.</hi> 12.) was to be Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated at Even: In the room whereof, becauſe Chriſt was to Inſtitute the Goſpel-Supper, it behooved to be taken after it, and not before it, being thereby to aboliſh and Antiquat the Paſſover. And if we were tied to every circumſtance of that firſt Goſpel-Supper,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:56523:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>then we behooved always to take it in an Upper Room, and with Twelve only in Company, yea, and after a Paſchal Lamb too; And albeit a <hi>Quaker</hi> ſhould anſwer, that this laſt named Circumſtance would be againſt Sciripture abrogating the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremonies; yet, it is hard to reply that all matters of Faith, and parts of Religious Worſhip, muſt be, not only not againſt Scripture, but according thereunto, and having Divine Appointment therein, (ſee <hi>Iſai.</hi> 8.20. <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.31, 32. and 19.5, 6. <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.9. <hi>Mark</hi> 7.7. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.20, 21, 22.) When therefore the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſhall be able to prove, that that Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of time when the firſt Goſpel-Supper was Celebrated is any Conſtituent part of the Sacrament with myſtical ſignification In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by Chriſt Jeſus, or, that it is any where of Scripture Commanded, then, and not till then, we ſhall acknowledge that we are in the wrong in taking it before Dinner; and this they are obliged to do, if they hold the Affirmative, (as here they pretend to do) ſeeing all parts of Religious Worſhip muſt have poſitive Scripture-Warrant, which if they want, they will be plain contrary to Scripture general Precepts, forbidding all Will-Worſhip after the commandments of Men.</p>
                  <p>Having thruſt out that limitating Clauſe <hi>[After Supper]</hi> from the ſtate of the Queſtion, we find the ſtate thereof to be yet Vitious: for it may either be underſtood of common eating of Bread and drinking of Wine; and ſo it is no Goſpel Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, ſeeing Drunkards and Heathens can do that unto exceſs in a Tavern. But Secondly, It may be underſtood (though with much ado, as it is propoſed) of Sacramental eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Bread and Wine Conſecrated, Sanctified, and ſet apart for a ſacred Symbol of Chriſts Death, for ſignifying and ſealing all the benefits thereof to the worthy Receivers, their Spiritual nouriſhment in Chriſt, and Communion with him and with each other.</p>
                  <p>In this ſence, I confidently aſſert the eating of Bread and drinking of Wine (as the <hi>Quakers</hi> mockingly term it) to be an excellent Goſpel-Ordinance Inſtituted by Chriſt Jeſus, to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in his Church to the Worlds end. This concluſion is ſo clear from <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. <hi>Chap.</hi> and <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. that nothing can be more clear. For firſt, We have in both places Chriſts Fact and Deed ſet down, that he took Bread and Wine and bleſſed them,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56523:69"/>that he brake the Bread, and put the Wine into the Cup, and that he diſtributed it to the Diſciples, and did eat and drink there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of with them. Secondly, We have Chriſts expreſs Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (albeit the blind <hi>Quakers</hi> cannot ſee it) injoyning the whole action to be, in like manner, done by his Church and People afterwards, <hi>This do,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.19. Thirdly, We have his Word of Promiſe Sacramentally enunciating the thing ſignified, or Internal matter of the External Signs and Symbols by a Metonimy, attributing the name of the thing ſignified to the Sign, expreſſing the Sacramental Union and Relation of the one to the other, wherein conſiſts the Internal form of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; <hi>This is my Body given for you; This Cup is the New Teſtament in my Blood ſhed for you, Luk.</hi> 22.19, 20. Laſtly, We have the Explication of the end of this Sacred Ordinance, which is, that it ſhould be for a memorial of Chriſt Death, <hi>This do in Remembrance of Me, Luk.</hi> 22.19. Now what blindneſs is happened to the <hi>Quakers,</hi> that they cannot here read Chriſts Inſtitution of the Goſpel-Supper, conſiſting of his own Fact, and a Commandment to his Church to do the like thereafter, with a rich Promiſe annexed, and the End of the work declared? Can any thing be deviſed more clear than this? Or, Can the <hi>Quakers</hi> number their own Fingers? What ſhall we think of them, when they can neither Read, nor hear when it is Read by others this clear Inſtitution of the Euchariſt, but that they are poſſeſſed with a blind and deaf Spirit that deprives them both of ſight and hearing?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, For a further aſſurance (if need were) that the Euchariſt is a Goſpel Ordinance of Divine Inſtitution, we have the Practice of the Apoſtles, and the whole Church after the pouring forth of the Spirit, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. in which places there is, not only the Example of the Churches Practice ſet down; but alſo further, we have their accuſtomed uſe thereof clearly imported, as any Man, by reading and conſidering the places, may ſee.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Apoſtle in the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> eleventh Chapter, while he is correcting ſeveral abuſes that were crept in into the Worſhip there, amongſt the reſt, calls them to the firſt Inſtitution of the Lords Supper; where in the 23. Verſe he affirms, that it was an Ordinance he had received of the Lord,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56523:69"/>and delivered unto them; and in the 26. Verſe he ſhews the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of it to be until Chriſts coming again. Now what an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream diſtraction ſhall it be to ſay, That Chriſt delivered an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance unto <hi>Paul</hi> to be by him delivered unto the Church, and to be by Her obſerved till Chriſts coming again at the day of general Judgment, and that for ſhewing forth his Death until then, which notwithſtanding is not a Goſpel-Ordinance Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by Chriſt? it's a horrid contradiction to ſay ſo. Is this the Spirit of Revelation (I ſhould ſay of occaecation and faſcina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) that the <hi>Quakers</hi> boaſt of? Oh miſerable Guide and grand Cheat, who, inſtead of a plain Path, (as he pretends) doth thus conduct them continually into the dark miſts of <hi>Cimmerian</hi> Clouds, or rather into the Chimerical Deſarts of <hi>Utopia,</hi> where all their Principles ſeems to concenter in the common place of Contradiction!</p>
                  <p>But, ſay the <hi>Quakers</hi> here, Is that a ſtanding Command? or is left to People? ſeeing it's ſaid, <hi>As oft as ye eat this Bread and drink this Cup, do it in Remembrance of his Death, and for ſhewing forth his Death till he come again.</hi> Was this Coming to the end of the World? Or was it till his coming to dwell in his Apoſtles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> See their Heretical <hi>Confeſſion of Faith,</hi> where they harp the ſame ſtring, <hi>page</hi> 26, 27, 77, 78, 79, 80.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> O <hi>miſeri, Quae tanta Inſania, cives? Quis furor?</hi> here is a whole heap of <hi>Romantick</hi> Fictious and Phantaſtick Dreams. For firſt here they alledge, that Chriſt did not dwell in his Apoſtles, when the firſt Goſpel-Supper was Celebrated, (and the ſame they alſo largely inſinuate in their <hi>Confeſſion, pages</hi> 72, 74, 75.) and ſo they behoove to be all at that time unregenerated Men meerly in Nature, ſeeing Chriſt by his Spirit dwells in all Regenerated Perſons and Believers, as theſe Scriptures witneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9, 10. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Galat.</hi> 4.6. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.24. But it is moſt falſe, that Chriſt did not dwell in his Apoſtles when the firſt Goſpel-Supper was Celebrated, and that they were then unregenerated Men, ſeeing Chriſt plainly declares, that they were clean, though not all, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 13.10) by this meaning of <hi>Judas</hi> the Traitor. And again he affirms, that they were clean through the Word that he had ſpoken unto them; (<hi>Joh.</hi> 15.3.) and again he ſays, that they had received the Word of God, and kept it, and knew ſurely that he came out from God, and that the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:56523:70"/>Father had ſent him, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 17.6, 7, 8.) and theſe are things which Fleſh and Blood never revealed unto them, and the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Man cannot diſcern, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed true, God had not at that time when the firſt Goſpel-Supper was Celebrated, furniſht the Apoſtles with the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit, to accompliſh them for their extraordinary work that enſued, but that was done at the <hi>Pentecoſt;</hi> but, that Chriſt did not Spiritually dwell in them before the <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures cited declares to be falſe: And as for that which Chriſt ſays to <hi>Peter, (Luk.</hi> 22.32.) <hi>When thou art Converted, ſtrengthen thy Brethren,</hi> it is not meant of the Converſion of his ſtate, as if he had been at that time unregenerated; but it is meant of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion from a particular Fact, or his Riſing after a Fall, as (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide what is already ſaid) is clear in the Text it ſelf: for Chriſt there tells him, that he had prayed for him that his Faith might not fail, which intimates that he then had Faith, and that it ſhould not be totally extinguiſht by the temptation he was to meet with, ſeeing Chriſts prayers were always heard, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.42.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They thereby inſinuate, That the Goſpel-Supper ſhould be allowed to none, but unregenerated Perſons in whom Chriſt dwells not, who will ſurely take it unworthily, and eat and drink their own Damnation therein, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.29.) for they do not here deny, but acknowledge, that the Apoſtles were by Chriſt admitted to the Goſpel-Supper before he came (as they would have it) to dwell in them; but they will not have them partaking of it after Chriſt is once come to dwell in them, alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that to be its period and term day: but Chriſt dwells in all Regenerated Perſons, as is proved: Therefore they allow the Goſpel-Supper to none, but Unregenerated Perſons, who cannot diſcern the Lords Body, nor ſhew forth his Death, which is not a bare Hiſtorical Remembrance of a thing paſt, but conſiſts in our Spiritual feeding by Faith upon Chriſt Crucified, and the application by Faith of him, and all the benefits of his Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption to our ſelves, in our thankfulneſs to him for ſo great benefits, and in our love towards him, and each other; which things Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerated Men meerly Carnal cannot do, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7, 8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11, 14. So then the <hi>Quakers</hi> in this point do directly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the Holy Ghoſt who requires, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.25, 26, 29.)

                  <p>Thirdly, They thereby alledge, That there is not a ſtanding Command left to the Church for Celebrating the Lords Supper, which I have ſhewed to be moſt falſe from <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.19. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23, 24. in both which places we have a clear Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ſet down, <hi>Do this in Remembrance of Me;</hi> which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, ſeeing it was never to this day repealed, (or elſe, let the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſhew where that is Recorded) muſt be as yet ſtanding ſtill in force; otherwiſe they may as well ſay, that all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands are repealed together, without any ground, as that this is repealed and not ſtanding, when they can ſhew us no ground for it from the whole Word of God.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, They thereby alledge, that the coming again of Chriſt mentioned, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. and which is no where elſe in all the Scriptures mentioned upon this purpoſe, is meant of Chriſts coming to dwell in his Apoſtles, <hi>viz.</hi> at the pouring forth of the Spirit at the <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> after which time they will not deny that Chriſt dwelt in them, (as their <hi>Confeſſion of Faith</hi> owns, <hi>pages</hi> 72, 73, 74, 75.) albeit they plainly teach that he did not dwell in them before that time. But it's impoſſible that Chriſts Coming again mentioned there, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26.) ſhould be meant of Chriſts pouring forth of the Spirit, or coming at the <hi>Pentecoſt;</hi> ſeeing Chriſts coming at the <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> was already paſt long before the writing of that Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinths,</hi> whereas his coming there mentioned is held forth as a thing meerly fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and not paſt; now it's a flat contradiction to ſay, a thing meerly future, and not paſt, is already paſt; and ſo his coming again mentioned in the Text of the <hi>Corinths,</hi> cannot be meant of his coming at the <hi>Pentecoſt.</hi> Again, The Euchariſt was Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated by the Apoſtles, and the Church after the <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> (when Chriſt either dwelt in the Apoſtles, or elſe never) <hi>Act.</hi> 2.42. and 20.7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. and 11.28. Therefore the period of the Goſpel Euchariſt could not be at the pouring out of the Spirit at the <hi>Pentecoſt.</hi> What? Did not Chriſt dwell in theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> whom <hi>Paul</hi> writes to? ſeeing they were ſanctified in Chriſt Jeſus, and juſtified in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God, and they were Temples to the Holy Ghoſt that dwelt in them, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. and 6.11, 19.) and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:56523:71"/>yet they did Celebrate the Goſpel-Supper among them, and that, by Divine Appointment, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. and 11.21, 23, 24, 28.) and ſo the Goſpel-Supper was appointed to be Celebrated by People in whom Chriſt doth already and previouſly dwell, yea none elſe but ſuch are allowed to partake of it, as is ſhewed before.</p>
                  <p>But need they then Bread and Wine (ſay the <hi>Quakers</hi>) to put them in Remembrance of him, after Chriſt is come to dwell in them?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Now the <hi>Quakers</hi> begin to diſpute and prove their Theſis againſt the Goſpel-Supper, and their Argument is a fruit of their conceipted perfection in this life, from whence they infer, that they need no Ordinances; albeit the Apoſtle affirms, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.2. and 13.9.12.) that our knowledge in this life is ſtill ſhort of that which it ought to be, and is but in part, and that all of it, is but dark and through a Glaſs; which ſhews that we have need of Means and Ordinances, as ſo many Perſpicils or Glaſſes to help our weak and dim-ſighted Eyes, without which we cannot take up the object. This conceipted Perfection of theirs I ſhall diſcuſs at the Fifteenth Query, when I come to it. But, wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>? Do theſe in whom Chriſt dwells need nothing to put them in Remembrance of him, (for the Argument carries as much againſt every ſuch thing, as againſt the Goſpel-Supper, as is manifeſt?) indeed this very well Homologates with their <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> where they decry all manner of External Ordinances, calling them Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, Carnal, Dead, Babyloniſh, Heatheniſh Obſervations, and the Whores Cup of Abominations in ſeveral places thereof, for which ſee it, <hi>pages</hi> 10, 24, 77, 79, 87, 92, 102, 104, 105, 108, 111, 122, 130, 133, 135. But, I am ſure, it ſuits not with the Scriptures any where, that ſhews us many Ordinances and Means appointed of God to keep us in mind of him, and our duty unto him, and particularly of the Sacred Supper, as a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial of what Chriſt hath done and Suffered for us; and our memories that are eſpecially weak in Spiritual things, have great need of Remembrancers, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.26. <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.1. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.13. and 3.1, 2. The Divine Inſtitution of the Goſpel-Supper, and the Commandment given to the Church to Celebrate the ſame, is enough to warrant our practice of it, (methinks) and our Imperfection in this life proclaims our need of it, and other helps
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:56523:71"/>and means; yea, <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocency had a Tree of Life allowed him of God to eat of, as a Symbol and Pledge of Life as long as he ſtood in his obedience, much more need have we of a Pledge to ſtrengthen our weak Faith.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, to ſhew us their good skill in Phyſical Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, they give us a very learned, and no leſs true definition of Death. To Dye with Chriſt (ſay they) is to come to the Death with him. But, is it ſo? Then never a Malefactor Died upon a Gibbet, but they Died always by the way while they were coming to it, ſeeing they were coming to their Death while they were by the way, and to Dye, and come to the Death is all one by this definition. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſhewed himſelf more expert in Phyſicks, when he diſtinguiſhed betwixt the Birth and coming to the Birth, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 37.3.) but he did not learn his Philoſophy at the <hi>Quakers</hi> School, it ſeems. They would have defined Death much better with <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that it is the loſs of heat and moiſture, becauſe the loſs of theſe infers it; or if they will ſtand to my Judgment, Death is the ſeparation of Soul and Body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the very diſſolution of their Union. But I ſhall paſs this, only I behoove to notice the ignorance of their Inſpirer in Naturals; as well as Spirituals.</p>
                  <p>In the next place they do again vainly repeat, that their fooliſh Argument now refuted and anſwered, <hi>viz.</hi> That they that are in the death of Chriſt, and buried with him, need not Bread and Wine to put them in Remembrance of his Death, the contrary whereof is abundantly ſhewed already, and we will not repeat; only I cannot but with aſtoniſhment wonder, that ſeeing Chriſt ſo peremptorily commands it, (whether it were needful for us, or not) <hi>This do in Remembrance of Me,</hi> they dare with their Brain-ſick fancies directly contradict Divine Commands. Oh! who (but the <hi>Quakers</hi> that have gotten a new Chriſt of their own to be ſaved by) would refuſe any Token that Chriſt had appointed for a Memorial of his Death, who wrote his love to us, which many waters could not quench, in the Characters of his Blood in the day that he was wounded for us in the Houſe of his friends?</p>
                  <p>But (ſay the <hi>Quakers</hi>) the Apoſtle ſays, they muſt riſe with Chriſt Jeſus; and if they be riſen with him, then ſeek theſe things that are above; and is not Bread and Wine from below?</p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:56523:72"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Here is another Argument againſt the Lords-Supper, and whereby they reproach and condemn all the Ordinances that ever God appointed from the beginning of the World, whereof any External Element was from below, as well as the Goſpel-Supper. Secondly, I anſwer, That the ſeeking of things that are above does not exclude, but on the contrary, includes the uſe of the means which God hath appointed for attaining them; ſeeing then the Lords-Supper is one of the means appointed of God for our better attaining things above, the uſe thereof is not there (<hi>viz. Coloſ.</hi> 3.1.) diſallowed, more than the uſe of Water is in Baptiſm, of which before. Thirdly, Let the Elements be from whence they will, yet I have ſhewed that the Goſpel-Supper Celebrated under theſe External Elements, as the Symbols is an Ordinance Inſtituted by Chriſt to be obſerved by the Goſpel Church, till his coming to the laſt Judgment. And what then can the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſay to enervat Chriſts Inſtitution? Fourthly, There is nothing in the Goſpel-Supper that is from below, excepting the meer External Elements materially and entitatively conſidered; for the Inſtitution, the Internal Subſtance, the Myſtical Signification, the Ends, and Effects thereof are all of them things Heavenly and from above; and ſo, though Bread and Wine Entitatively conſidered be from below, yet, the Sacrament of the Supper, and Bread and Wine taken Sacramentally are not from below; for Bread and Wine ſimply, or in themſelves do not make a Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Euchariſt, more than a Body without a Soul makes a Man, as is palpable from many things above ſaid.</p>
                  <p>The ſeeking therefore of theſe things, above (mentioned <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.1.) is meant only in oppoſition to the ſeeking of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral commodities belonging to this Life, and that, not in every reſpect either; but as the chief ſcope of our Actions, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 6.33.) or to fulfil our Luſts, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 13.14.) or with inordinate care and affection, (<hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.22.) or with anxious diſtruſt, (<hi>Luk.</hi> 12.29.) or by unlawful means, or without ſubmiſſion to God: for, that we may ſeek our worldly neceſſaries alſo, as Secundary means, moderately, without anxious care, by lawful means, for the right uſe, and with ſubmiſſion; is manifeſt from the Scriptures, for which, inſtead of many, ſee only <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.11. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.8. and if any Man would have us no ways looking after our Corporal neceſſaries, either he would have us
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:56523:72"/>to live without them, (which a <hi>Quaker</hi> may try upon himſelf) or elſe to uſe no means (at leaſt) for the obtaining of them; and then we ſhall Plow and Sow no more, but be ſupplied by Miracles. The paſſage of Scripture which they cite from 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.18. will no ways Patroniſe their Erroneous Cauſe; (though they alſo cite it to the ſame very purpoſe in their <hi>Confeſſion, page</hi> 79.) For the Apoſtle in that place is ſpeaking of his afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, troubles, and the loſs of worldly things which he endured for the Goſpel, and theſe he oppoſes there unto Eternal Life, calling theſe the things that are ſeen, and this the thing that is not ſeen; and theſe troubles, and the loſs of theſe enjoyments he counted but a ſmall buſineſs and a light affliction, (as it is there <hi>ver.</hi> 17.) But will any Man ſay, that he counted it but a light affliction to be deprived of the Goſpel-Supper? This would not have become <hi>Paul.</hi> But I need not Apologize for him; he purges himſelf ſufficiently of this; for the whole purpoſe of that Chapter ſhews his meaning to be of the things that I have ſaid. Again, the External Signs in the Lords Supper, rightly conſidered as ſignifying and exhibiting Chriſt and his benefits, are ſo far from turning our Eyes, or hearts to things that are below and ſeen, that on the contrary, they are an excellent means of of elevating them unto, and ſetting them upon the things that are above and not ſeen?</p>
                  <p>That the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were jangling, and in a diſorder when <hi>Paul</hi> wrote the ſecond Epiſtle to them; (from which the <hi>Quakers</hi> cite this paſſage) I truly perceive not; yea, the Seventh Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thereof witneſſes the contrary: and ſo the <hi>Quakers</hi> have miſtaken the ſecond Epiſtle for the firſt.</p>
                  <p>In the Cloſe of this Query, the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſhew themſelves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to the Accuſer of the Brethren: for (glory to God) there are many Miniſters amongſt us, who have intended, not without ſucceſs, that both themſelves and their Hearers ſhould come nearer Chriſts Death, than the eating and drinking of Bread and Wine for a bare Hiſtorical Remembrance of his Death, (as the <hi>Quakers</hi> here inſinuate it to have been) whom, becauſe their Epiſtles of Commendation are written upon the hearts of many Thouſands, we ſhall not need here further, either to vindicate or commend them.</p>

                  <hi>Whether or not Chriſt and the Apoſtles gave forth a Command that they ſhould keep the Sabbath-day? let us ſee where it is written in the Scriptures, but the firſt day of the Week the Saints did meet together: this is Scripture; but let us ſee the Scripture for a Sabbath-day in the New-Teſtament, which ſpeaks for a reſt for the People of God. But is this a day? yea, or nay?</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Quakers</hi> Poſition here is, That there is no day under the New Teſtament appointed to be kept as an External Chriſtian Sabbath-day more than another, but that all days are of equal Condition and Holineſs, as (beſide what they here ſay) they alſo teach more plainly in their <hi>Confeſſion of Faith,</hi> page 42. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which I aſſert, that there is an External Chriſtian Sabbath-day appointed to be obſerved under the New Teſtament, diſtinct from all other days whatſoever. For proving of this Concluſion, I need not bring the ordinary Argument from the light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture concerning ſome portion of our time and days to be ſet apart from all civil and worldly Imployments to the exerciſe of Gods Publick Worſhip, (which none, but a profeſt Atheiſt will deny) knowing that the party I have to deal with (ſcarce both of Religion and Reaſon) do but little value it.</p>
                  <p>But firſt, We are commanded in the fourth Commandment to keep holy unto God one day of ſeven, and this Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is Moral, and ſo perpetual, extending to all Ages of the Church: Therefore there is a command for keeping an External Sabbath-day under the New-Teſtament, as well as the Old. The conſequence is of it ſelf clear to any Man. The firſt part of the Antecedent is alſo clear from <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. Chap. I prove the ſecond part thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> that this Commandment is Moral, and ſo perpetual, becauſe God proclaimed it with his own Voice
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56523:73"/>from Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> to the whole Aſſembly of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he wrote it with his own Finger, he inſerted it into the midſt of the reſt of the Moral Precepts, he wrote it upon the Tables of Stone ſhewing its perpetual duration, and he cauſed put it into the Ark of the Teſtimony with the reſt of the Moral Precepts; all which is clear from <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. Chap. throughout, and 25.16. and 31.18. and 32.15, 16. <hi>Deut.</hi> 9.10. and 10.4. But God never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the like honour upon any Precept meerly Ceremonial, as is plain from the Scriptures. Again, all the reaſons of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment are intirely Moral, and ſtand upon common and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual equity: <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſo muſt the Command it ſelf be. The reaſons chiefly are, ſeeing he himſelf reſted after ſix days work finiſhed, and he allows us ſix days to our work: Therefore in all reaſon and equity we ought to reſt after ſo many days allowed to our work, and give God a ſeventh. Laſtly, If this Command were not Moral, then there ſhould not be Ten, but only Nine Commandments of that Law, which is plain contrary to <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.13. and 10.4. where <hi>Moſes</hi> manifeſtly ſpeaks of the Moral Law which God ſpake in the Mount out of the midſt of the Fire, and plainly affirms that there are Ten Commandments thereof; from which Law Chriſt ſhews us, that one jot ſhall not paſs away till Heaven and Earth paſs, and that the leaſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment thereof muſt be perpetually obſerved, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.18, 19.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Quakers</hi> anſwer, That the Sabbath commanded in the fourth Commandment was the laſt day of the week, which is abrogated. Unto this I reply, that the accommodation of the particular time or dyet to the laſt day of the week is indeed abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated; but not the ſubſtance of the Command, which (for the convincing reaſons now given) is plainly Moral, and ſo perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and as yet in force; and ſo it doth no leſs now injoyn the firſt day of the week to be obſerved, the accomodation of the particular Dyet being made unto the firſt day, then it did then, injoyn the laſt day of the week to be obſerved, by reaſon of the then-accommodation made unto the laſt day, ſeeing it ſtill retains its Authority for a ſeventh day, or one day of ſeven to be kept holy unto God, (wherein the ſubſtance of the Precept conſiſts) which of them ſoever he ſhall pitch upon and determine.</p>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:56523:74"/>
                  <p>As for the change of the particular day, from the laſt to the firſt of the week, (doubtleſs) Chriſt himſelf in his own Perſon is the Author thereof, ſeeing (beſide that he Roſe thereupon, and reſted from the great work of Redemption, which is the great ground of the change) he gives it the honour of his moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent appearings thereafter to his Diſciples, (<hi>Luk.</hi> 24.13, 15. <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.19, 26.) and again of that glorious manifeſtation of himſelf in the pouring forth of the Spirit at the <hi>Pentecoſt, (Act.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3, 4.) and again, it was on this day (as ſhall be ſhewed) that he made that glorious appearance to <hi>John</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Patmos, (Revel.</hi> 1.10.) again, the firſt day of the week was by the Apoſtles and the Church (following their Maſters Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, which is binding in things imitable, and that by Divine Precept, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.1.) obſerved for the Celebrating of Gods Publick Worſhip as a day ſet apart for that work, as appears from <hi>Act.</hi> 20.7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.1, 2. where we have not a meer bare Example or inſtance of the Churches meeting for once or twice to Gods Publick Worſhip on that day ſet down, but alſo we have their conſtant cuſtom of ſo doing clearly in both places import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; yea further, the laſt of theſe two Texts ſhews, that, that day was ſet apart for the Publick Divine Worſhip, while it expreſly requires the publick Collections of Charity for the Poor, (a Pendicle of the Publick Worſhip) to be made on that day, and ſhews that the ſame order was alſo given to other Churches, as well as to them of <hi>Corinth.</hi> And laſtly, the Holy Ghoſt hath recorded to us theſe ſingular Priviledges and peculiar Honour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed by Chriſt upon this firſt day of the week above all other days, as alſo the Churches obſerving of it for Gods Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and that conſtantly, and as a day ſet apart for that uſe; and the like he doth not mention of any other day, which is very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable. What is all this for, then? for ſome reaſon, uncontro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertibly; and yet no other can be given, or fall under imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; (or elſe I intreat the <hi>Quakers</hi> to ſhew us it, if they can) But, that the firſt day of the week is a day peculiarly ſet apart and ſanctified by Chriſt for the Exerciſe of his Publick Worſhip, and which he would have his Church peculiarly to regard, as deſigned for that holy uſe, beyond and above all other days, as was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly done by the Apoſtles and Church in the pure Primitive times. The change of the day then is moſt ſurely by Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:56523:74"/>
                  <p>But Secondly, when Chriſt foretels the Diſciples of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the Temple by <hi>Veſpaſian, (Matth.</hi> 24.20.) which was fourty years and upwards after Chriſts Aſcenſion, and ſo it was long after the planting of the Goſpel-Church, and exautorating of the Ceremonial Law; He bids them pray, that their flight might not be in the Winter, nor on the Sabbath-day. There, is a Sabbath-day both name and thing under the New Teſtament, which Chriſt wills his Diſciples to pray, that their flight might not be thereupon, becauſe it would be grievous to them to be forced to travel for preſervation of their natural Lives on that day which was Inſtituted for Gods Publick Worſhip, and their Spiritual comfort. Neither is it poſſible to get the Sabbath-day here mentioned, meaned of every day, ſeeing then they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooved either to flee on the Sabbath-day or elſe never: Nor yet can it be meant of an uncertain day, or ſome day Indeterminately; for then, the Diſciples could not have known what day to pray, that their flight might not be upon, and Chriſts Exhortation had been vain, and to no uſe or purpoſe, which is moſt abſurd and falſe. This one Scripture proves a Chriſtian External Sabbath-day againſt all Contradicters; and that the firſt day of the week muſt be this Chriſtian Sabbath-day, appears from the Claim and Intereſt above declared, which it hath under the New Teſtament unto that honourable Title and peculiar Denomination above all other days, and that by Divine Warrant.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, There is a particular determinate day under the New Teſtament which hath, by the mind and ſentiments of the Scripture, a peculiar relation unto the Lord Chriſt, above all other days whatſoever; and ſo it is ſeparated from the common condition of all other days, having a peculiar Divine relation, which no other hath, and thereby a preheminence and dignity before all of them; and ſo it muſt be an Holy Day, ſeeing common days are not ſeparated from the condition of common days, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we pleaſe to ſpeak plain contradiction. That there is ſuch a particular determinate day under the New Teſtament, is clear from <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.10. where <hi>John</hi> ſays, He was in the Spirit on the <hi>Lords-day,</hi> which cannot be meant of every day, ſeeing then, he could not have been in the Spirit but on the Lords-day, whereas it is moſt evident, that <hi>John</hi> diſtinctly points at a particular day having ſome peculiar relation to Chriſt above all others.</p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:56523:75"/>
                  <p>But the <hi>Quakers</hi> (like Dictators) ſay, that the Lords-day here is meant of an uncertain time, called the Lords-day, becauſe of the Lords ſpecial appearing thereupon. But their Commentary is moſt falſe, and cannot agree with the Apoſtles Scope, which is, as to ſhew the certain Perſon Who received the Viſion, (viz. <hi>John</hi>) and the certain place of the World Where, <hi>(In the Iſle of Patmos)</hi> and the certain kind of frame Wherein, <hi>(While he was in the Spirit)</hi> ſo alſo the certain kind of day, or the certain day of the week whereupon he received the Viſion; and ſo an uncertain time cannot ſtand with the Scope. Secondly, Let the <hi>Quakers</hi> (if they can) prove that an uncertain time is here meant, or elſe their Gloſs upon the Text will be juſtly thought uncertain. Thirdly, Our Adjective does not very perfectly turn the word, which in the Original Language is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, ſignifying Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick, or (more clearly) pertaining to the Lord, which plainly imports a particular determinate day, (adding <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> with it, which is in the Text) having a peculiar and ſtated relation to the Lord above others, which by common right are his alſo. Having diſpatched the <hi>Quakers</hi> uncertain time, I affirm, that the Lords-day here is meant of the firſt day of the week determinately, ſeeing it hath a peculiar intereſt into that Denomination above all other days whatſoever; for, it is the day of Chriſts glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and ceaſing from the great work of Redemption, (whereof it is a Remembrance;) it is the day of his frequent appearings to his Diſciples thereafter; it is the day of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious pouring forth of the Spirit, and enduing the Apoſtles with Power from on High; it is the day ſet apart for his Publick Worſhip, and obſerved alſo for that uſe by the Apoſtles and Church in the pure Primitive time; and finally, it is the day which the Holy Ghoſt hath particularly noted unto us, as alone honoured by Chriſt and his Church with ſuch peculiar Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges; all which is before proved. Seeing then the firſt day of the week hath, upon ſo many ſpecial accompts, ſo peculiar an Intereſt into that Denomination, which no other can pretend to; The Lords day here mentioned, muſt be inevitably underſtood of the ſame, ſeeing the beſt right muſt and ought to gain the Cauſe, except we reſolve utterly to abandon our Reaſon, or elſe determine againſt clear Juſtice. Let the <hi>Quakers</hi> then ſhew us ſome other day with a better, or as good right; or elſe, prove
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:56523:75"/>from the Text, or otherwiſe, that ſome other day, certain or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain is meant, (which I defie them to do) otherwiſe theſe clear Scripture-grounds muſt bear more weight, than their meer bare word and naked aſſertions.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Quakers</hi> will object againſt an External Sabbath-day under the New-Teſtament, that the Apoſtle condemns the obſervation of days and Sabbath-days, <hi>Galat.</hi> 4.10. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.16.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Apoſtle does not there or any where elſe, condemn the obſervation of the Chriſtian Sabbath-day, but only of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Sabbath-days, (with any others that never had Divine Warrant, againſt which the Argument infers a <hi>Fortiori</hi>) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, beſide their ordinary weekly Sabbath-day, they had a great many, ſuch as were the firſt and laſt days of every one of their three Solemn Feaſts, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Paſſover, of Pentecoſt or Weeks, and of Tabernacles; as alſo their Feaſt of Trumpets on the firſt day of the ſeventh Month, and the Feaſt of Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Attonement on the tenth day of the ſeventh Month; and beſide all theſe, their New Moons, their Sabbath of Years, and great Jubilies; all which may be ſeen <hi>Levit.</hi> 23. and 25. <hi>Chap.</hi> and <hi>Numb.</hi> 10. <hi>Chap.</hi> And that it is ſuch days as theſe, and not our Chriſtian Sabbath-day, the obſerving whereof the Apoſtle condemns, is clear in the very Context of theſe two cited places; for in the firſt Text, he expreſly names Months and Years, that is, New Moons and Sabbaths of Years, and the intire ſcope of the Epiſtle is bent againſt <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremonies, pertaining to the then-Bondage-ſtate of the Infant-Church under the Old-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as any man reading it may ſee. And in the laſt Text, he ranks theſe Sabbaths which he rejects, with Meats, and Drinks and New Moons, and calls them ſhadows of things to come, of which kind our Chriſtian Sabbath-day is not. Nor is all diſtinction of days, without exception, taken away here, more than the diſtinction of the Elements in the Lords-Supper from other common Meat and Drink, (which, that it is not taken away, I have proved at the Survey of the laſt Query) ſeeing, both Meats and Drinks and Days are here equally condemned, or not ſo. What? Does <hi>Paul</hi> here condemn the obſervation of the Chriſtian Sabbath-day, which Chriſt teaches we ſhall
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:56523:76"/>have under the New-Teſtament? or, Does he reſcind the fourth Commandment? or, Condemns he the obſervation of the Day which himſelf and the whole Church obſerved, as ſet apart for Gods Publick Worſhip? ſay not ſo, I pray.</p>
                  <p>Again, they will Object that the ſame Apoſtle holds forth the Indiſtinction and equal Condition of all days, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.5.6.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> That is moſt falſe, for the unanſwerable reaſons now given. Secondly, by the Context it ſelf, the days there Treated of, are ſuch as are in the ſame order with Ceremonial Meats and Drinks of <hi>Jewiſh</hi> obſervation, the eſtimation whereof above others was an Infirmity in the weaker ſort to be born with by the ſtronger, until their better Information and Perſuaſion: But the Chriſtian Sabbath-day is not of that ſort, as is ſhewed. Nor does <hi>Paul</hi> here any more overturn the diſtinction of the Chriſtian Sabbath-day from other common days, then of the Elements in the Lords-Supper from other common Meat and Drink, which it is certain he does not overturn, ſeeing theſe in the Lords-Supper are of a very far different Condition from all common Meat and Drink, in regard of their Inſtitution, Signification, Ends, Effects, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Cloſe of their Query they tell us, that the Scriptures ſpeaks for a Reſt for the people of God. But is this Reſt (ſay they) limited to a day?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> What then, I pray? the Scriptures promiſe the Eternal Reſt of Heaven to all true Believers, whereof alſo their Grace and Sanctification is an Earneſt and Degree inchoat and begun here, though not perfected. But will this prove that there ſhould not be, or is not an external Sabbath-day under the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? then neither ſhould there have been any under the Old either, ſeeing the Reſt of Heaven was promiſed to Believers then, as well as now. And all true Believers had ſome meaſure of Grace and Sanctification then, as well as now. Or will our reſting from ſin in ſome meaſure begun in this Life, or our Eternal Reſting in Heaven in the next Life infer, that we ſhould reſt from our Duty in this Life? Forſooth ſuch Conſequences are very ſutable to the <hi>Quakers</hi> Logick.</p>
                  <p>But, ſay the <hi>Quakers</hi> (which is their laſt Gun) every day is a Holy day to a Chriſtian.</p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:56523:76"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> I grant a Chriſtian ſhould be Holy every day, and keep an Internal Sabbath, as they call it. But it will not from thence follow, that we have not an External Sabbath-day alſo; for <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocency when he maintained, and was bound to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a continual Internal Sabbath of Sanctification, had, for all that, an External Sabbath-day alſo (<hi>Gen.</hi> 2.3.) and the <hi>Jews</hi> under the Old Teſtament were bound to maintain an Internal Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath of Sanctification every day, and yet they had an External Sabbath-day alſo. For an External Sabbath-day requires, not only that we ceaſe from ſin and be holy, but alſo that we ceaſe from all our Civil and worldly Imployments, and Works that on other days are Lawful (excepting works of neceſſity and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy which are every day Duties) and in that abſtraction from the world, ſpend the whole day in the publick and private Exerciſe of Divine Worſhip; which things could not be done every day even by <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocency. And if every day were a Holy day to us, we behoove either to Plow and Sow on Holy day, or elſe not do ſuch things at all; both which are utterly abſurd.</p>

                  <p>The State of the Queſtion here is very plain. The <hi>Quakers</hi> deny our Singing of <hi>Pſalms</hi> to be an Ordinance of the Goſpel, or of Divine Inſtitution under the New Teſtament. Contrary unto this,</p>
                  <p>I Aſſert that Singing of <hi>Pſalms</hi> is an Ordinance of the New Teſtament Divinely appointed. I prove it. Therefore firſt, Singing of <hi>Pſalms</hi> was an Ordinance of Divine Inſtitution under the Old Teſtament, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95.2. and 105.2. Therefore it muſt be ſo ſtill under the New. The Scriptures Cited prove the Antecedent. I prove the Conſequence, becauſe Singing of <hi>Pſalms</hi> was no <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremony, and if the Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries will ſay ſo, let them prove their Affirmative, as they are obliged; and until then I ſhall confirm the Negative, <hi>viz.</hi> that Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Pſalms</hi> is no <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremony, becauſe firſt, I cannot think that Chriſt joyned a <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremony after the Goſpel-Supper, when he Sung a Hymn, or <hi>Pſalm</hi> (as it is on the Margine of ſome of our Bibles) <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.30. <hi>Mark.</hi> 14.26. Nor that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> uſed any <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremony, eſpecially there not being any fear of Offence and ſtumbling of weak Brethren there, when in Priſon they Sung Praiſes unto God, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.25. Again, the Apoſtle does very plainly Exhort the Chriſtians of the New Teſtament (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.19. and <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.16.) to ſpeak unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in <hi>Pſalms,</hi> Hymns, and Spiritual Songs, Singing and making Melody in their hearts unto the Lord; and Teaching and Admoniſhing one another in <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and Hymns, and Spiritual Songs, Singing with Grace in their hearts unto the Lord; In which Texts he ſhews, that that piece of Worſhip is edifying both to our ſelves, and alſo to others that joyn with us, while he ſays, ſpeaking to our ſelves in <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and Admoniſhing one another in <hi>Pſalms.</hi> And Secondly, that it is a comfortable and Heart-chearing Duty, while he ſays making Melody in your hearts. And Thirdly, that it glorifies God, while he ſays, doing it unto the Lord: Therefore Singing of <hi>Pſalms</hi> can be no <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremony, having theſe Examples and Precepts for it to the Church of the New Teſtament.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> (<hi>Chap.</hi> 14.15.26.)
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:56523:77"/>The Apoſtle, in the one place of the Chapter and Verſes Cited, ſharply reproves the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for their Diſorder and Confuſion in Singing in the publick Aſſemblies, becauſe every one of them had a <hi>Pſalm</hi> by themſelves, and did not all joyn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and in the other place he directeth them how to Sing <hi>Pſalms</hi> aright, <hi>viz.</hi> with the Spirit and with the underſtanding alſo, that is, not only with the Breath, or voice (which there he calls the Spirit; and the ſignification from the Original word, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, moſt properly ſignifies the Breath, or Wind) but alſo in a known Tongue, which the whole Context there declares he means when he ſays, with the Underſtanding; and ſo the Apoſtle does here Reform the abuſe that was crept in into their publick Singing of <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and directs them how to do it aright. But a Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Will-worſhip (ſuch as Singing of <hi>Pſalms</hi> muſt be, if it be not of Divine Inſtitution) can never be performed aright, it involves a plain Contradiction to ſay ſo. What? did <hi>Paul</hi> direct men how to Worſhip God aright by a Superſtitious Will-worſhip? Nay, ſurely not. Singing of <hi>Pſalms</hi> then muſt undeniably be an Ordinance of Divine Inſtitution under the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſays (<hi>Jam.</hi> 5.13.) <hi>Is any man afflicted? let him pray, is any man merry? let him Sing Pſalms:</hi> Therefore Singing of <hi>Pſalms</hi> hath a Divine Warrant under the New Teſtament. The <hi>Quakers</hi> anſwer, that he bids us Sing <hi>Pſalms</hi> only when we are merry. But, it ſeems then, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> are never, never Merry, but are a number of Sullen, Dull, and Melancholick Hypocondriack Drones, who cannot at all Sing <hi>Pſalms.</hi> Secondly, there is no ſuch excluſion in the Text, as is pretended; otherwiſe the Apoſtle bids us pray only when we are afflicted alſo, ſeeing both theſe are pronounced with one Breath, and the manner of the Expreſſion and extent of the Terms are the ſame in both; and the <hi>Quakers</hi> can ſhew no ground for excluſion in the one, more than the other, notwithſtanding they may ſee how frequently and continually we are commanded to pray, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.18. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.6. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.17.</p>
                  <p>They may alſo ſee Chriſt and his Diſciples Singing when by all Circumſtances it appears they were Sorrowful, ſeeing they were ſo both preſently before and after, as appears from <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.22. <hi>Mark.</hi> 14.26. compared with <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.30.38. <hi>Mark.</hi> 14.19.34. <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.21. The Apoſtle therefore by Merrineſs and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:56523:78"/>Affliction points at the frame and caſe unto which theſe Duties are moſt eſpecially ſuited, no ways excluding the excerciſe of them in other frames and caſes. But let us give them for once (not granting) that the Apoſtle does there appoint us to Sing <hi>Pſalms</hi> only when we are Merry; yet Singing of <hi>Pſalms</hi> ſhall by this Text (even in the Adverſaries own Sence) be of Divine Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion under the New Teſtament; or elſe (in their Principles) we may in our Merry and Joyful frames offer a Superſtitious Will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip unto God, which I have not yet learnt to believe.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Quakers</hi> applying this Text of <hi>James</hi> in the 130 page of their Confeſſion of Faith anſwer us, that there is none Merry, but the Ranſomed of the Lord; and therefore they mean to infer (for that is their Scope in the place) that none ſhould Sing <hi>Pſalms,</hi> but theſe.</p>
                  <p>But Firſt, then certainly the <hi>Quakers</hi> are Convict, that they themſelves are none of the Ranſomed of the Lord, ſeeing they here allow the Ranſomed of the Lord to Sing <hi>Pſalms,</hi> which yet they cannot be perſuaded to do.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, all the Members of the viſible Church profeſſing Faith in Chriſt, and ſubjecting to his Ordinances, are by viſible Profeſſion, and in ſome degree of the judgment of Charity, the Ranſomed of the Lord: Therefore the <hi>Quakers</hi> (by their own principles) ought to allow them to Sing <hi>Pſalms.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, others alſo, beſide the Ranſomed of the Lord, are bound to Worſhip God, except ſome ſpecial piece of Worſhip, by ſome ſpecial Conditions which it requires, doth exclude them, as the Lords Supper excludes all that do not, or cannot Examine themſelves, diſcern the Lords Body, and ſhew forth his Death (albeit the Church in admitting perſons muſt walk by probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and can reach no further) and both it and Baptiſm excludes all that want a viſible Intereſt into the Covenant: But Singing of <hi>Pſalms</hi> is a piece of Gods appointed Worſhip (as is ſhewed) and there is no ſpecial condition Recorded in all the Scripture that debars any man from Singing and joyning therein; or elſe let the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſhew it, if they can. If they ſhall ſay (as we ſee they do ſay) that the Unranſomed by this Text are excluded from Singing <hi>Pſalms,</hi> they ſhall ſpeak falſly: for (beſide our former reaſons given already to this exception) the Text exhorts any man (Whatſoever he be) unto that duty, but eſpecially when
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:56523:78"/>he is in a joyful frame. And giving (without granting) the Ranſomed only to be meant, yet Pſalms-ſinging will ſtill be of Divine Inſtitution, if theſe be allowed, and in the judgment of Charity theſe will be all the profeſſing Members of the Church ſubjecting to Divine Ordinances. And whereas they here alledge, that the Ranſomed only are Merry, or joyful, that is alſo falſe, for others, beſide theſe, are ſometimes joyful (<hi>Mat.</hi> 13.20. <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.13.) and ſo the exception is to no purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Quakers</hi> inſinuate here an Argument againſt Pſalms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinging, <hi>viz.</hi> that its very unſuitable to make Songs of <hi>Davids</hi> ſad Caſes of Mourning, Weeping, Lamenting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> But its much more unſuitable for the <hi>Quakers</hi> to preſume themſelves Wiſer than God and <hi>David,</hi> who have cauſed make, and made Songs on <hi>Davids</hi> ſad Caſes, as the Title which (almoſt) every where they get, and which Chriſt gives them (<hi>Luk.</hi> 20.42. and 24.44.) ſufficiently declares. If then they cenſure it as a fault in us to Sing <hi>Davids</hi> ſad Lots, much more do they Tax God and <hi>David</hi> for making Songs of them, and ordaining them to be Sung.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this proves only (if any thing) that we ſhould not Sing <hi>Pſalms</hi> made upon ſad Caſes. Why will not the <hi>Quakers</hi> Sing other <hi>Pſalms?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if the reading of theſe ſad Lots of <hi>David</hi> can yield any Edification (which is certain) the Singing of them may yield the ſame, ſeeing Singing is nothing elſe but a Melodious kind of reading, a reading with a Tune.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the Singing of <hi>Davids</hi> Weepings, Lamentings, Complaints, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is not therefore unſuitable to us, becauſe the Caſes were afflicting to <hi>David</hi> while he was under them: for albeit theſe were afflicting to him for the time; yet the after Memory of them is very comfortable to us (and to himſelf when they were over. <hi>Forſan &amp; haec olim meminiſſe juvabit,</hi> ſaid the Poet) unto whom the like Caſes are alſo incident; for its comfortable to us to ſee the Path beaten by ſo worthy a Saint as <hi>David,</hi> and it would be ſad to us to think that our Lot in ſuch a Caſe never befel any Saint.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, the making Songs upon, and Singing of theſe ſad Caſes Teaches us, that even in our ſaddeſt Lots there is ſtill ſome matter of praiſe to God, and for which we ought to Sing unto his Name, yea and alſo that we ought therein to chear up our hearts rejoycing
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:56523:79"/>in God, and not give our ſelves over to be ſwallowed up of heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs deſpondency. Thus far, beſide the Divine Inſtitution, (which is enough againſt all they can bring) I have ſatisfied the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</p>
                  <p>But, ſay the <hi>Quakers,</hi> With what confidence can a Man ſing ſuch paſſages as theſe, <hi>viz. We have not dealt falſly in thy Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, neither have our hearts turned back, Pſal.</hi> 44.17, 18.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> This will only prove, (if it could prove any thing) that backſlidden Chriſtians may not ſing ſuch paſſages, and yet it hinders them not to ſing other <hi>Pſalms.</hi> The <hi>Quakers</hi> then are certainly convict, (as the truth is) that themſelves are a back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlidden People, ſeeing they have no confidence to ſing ſuch paſſages.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Whither now is the <hi>Quakers</hi> Perfection gone? per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect folk may ſing them, or elſe none may.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We may ſing theſe as our ſincere and conſtant adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to God, (which is all their meaning) albeit we be not perfect in our obedience; and the greateſt Saint in <hi>Iſrael</hi> could do no further.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, We may ſing them as through grace, both poſſible and hoped for by us, though we be not as yet come that length.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, We may ſing them as other Mens attainments (for which we are bound to praiſe God) on their behalf, or putting our ſelves in their room, though they be not our own attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Some of theſe ways any Man may ſing them.</p>
                  <p>But, ſay the <hi>Quakers,</hi> its ſaid, <hi>We have not dealt falſly, &amp;c.</hi> which, if it be not ſo with us, we lie, ſeeing its ſaid, We.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> But then we may not read ſuch paſſages either, if the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument be good: for when we read them, we muſt read We, as well as ſing We; again, this hinders us not to ſing them as the attainments of others putting our ſelves in their room, and acting in their behalf, which is ordinary in other things.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Albeit it be not ſo with us at preſent, yet we may ſing them in hope, fore-acting (as it were) the caſe wherein upon good grounds we hope to be Conſtituted, ſeeing we may praiſe God for things hoped for, and (as it were) pre-occupy the poſſeſſion of them. See theſe two objections propoſed in like terms and like inſtances, in the <hi>Quakers Confeſſion of Faith,</hi> pages 129, 130.</p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:56523:79"/>
                  <p>Again they object, That there are ſeveral places wherein there are many Curſes pronounced, (as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109.) which therefore ought not to be ſung, becauſe thereby People are made to Curſe.</p>
                  <p>

Thirdly, We may not indeed rejoyce in any mans miſery, as ſuch; yet, when God is glorified by his Righteous Judgments upon ſuch Perſons, we may rejoyce upon that account, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 58.10. <hi>Revel.</hi> 19. <hi>Chap.</hi> to <hi>Ver.</hi> 6. Laſtly, Seeing God himſelf hath cauſed make <hi>Pſalms</hi> of theſe Curſes, againſt ſuch notorious Enemies to him, and hath ordained them to be ſung, (ſeeing (as is now proved) he hath ordained us to ſing the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and he hath no where excepted any <hi>Pſalm</hi> from that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rule) we may ſurely, ſing ſuch <hi>Pſalms;</hi> Nay, we may not make exceptions at our own hand from Divine Rules, where the Rule it ſelf excepts not. Who dare preſume, without Gods Authority, to diminiſh and reſtrict his Laws? Nay, they might as well make his whole Laws null and void, as ſo to retrench them, without his Authority. Anſwer my Arguments if they can.</p>

But will ye tell me, Does not ſome of your ſelves preach (if it might be called ſo) when your Spirit, (that often takes a long time to ſtudy his Sermon, (though ye your ſelves take none, ye ſay, and condemns them that do, (<hi>Quakeriſm no Popery,</hi> page, 99.) or elſe he has the Palſie in his Tongue) comes upon you? ſeeing we are appointed to ſing <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and we cannot do that, except they be Meetered, and the turning of <hi>Pſalms</hi> into Meeter requires a good Muſitian,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:56523:80"/>or good Poet, rather than an immediatly Inſpired Apoſtle; we may ſing <hi>Pſalms,</hi> though by others than Apoſtles they be put into a Metral form to us. Yea, ſeeing the Apoſtles did not Meeter them in our Language, and yet we are Ordained to ſing them, which requires that they be Meetered in the ſame, they muſt be put into Meeter by ſome of our ſelves, or elſe we cannot obey the command to ſing them.</p>
                  <p>But, ſay the <hi>Quakers,</hi> Have ye the ſame Spirit the Apoſtles had, or a larger meaſure of it than they had, by which ye have turned theſe into Meeter ſince the Apoſtles days?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> The ſame Spirit we have, though not the ſame meaſure: for, albeit there are diverſities of gifts amongſt Believers, yet they have all the ſame Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.4, 13. But behold here a rare fanſie: The <hi>Quakers</hi> require either (at leaſt) the ſame meaſure, or elſe a larger meaſure of the Spirit, than the Apoſtles had, for turning the <hi>Pſalms</hi> into Meeter. What? will no leſs meaſure of the Spirit, than the Apoſtles had, ſerve to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand Poetry and the Notes of Muſick? Muſt we be immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly Inſpired for theſe two? O brave Morology! The <hi>Quakers</hi> (it ſeems) will not allow a Boy to ſing a Song, nor a Minſtreller to play his Tune, (both which requires ſomething of Muſick) without immediate Inſpiration, forſooth. <hi>Spectatum admiſſi riſum teneatis amici?</hi> The <hi>Quakers</hi> (it ſeems) do not like to be Precenters, leſt (perhaps) they get little Salary.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, They ask, what the <hi>Pſalms</hi> were that were ſung in the Primitive times?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> They were certainly, the ſame that we now ſing, ſeeing theſe only are written in the Scriptures, (though the <hi>Quakers</hi> may have other <hi>Pſalms</hi> in their wild Scripture-Book within) and appointed by God to be ſung, as (beſide that, we are Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to ſing <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and there is no other to chooſe upon) is clear from 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.30. where the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſang praiſes to God with the words of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Aſaph,</hi> ſays the Text, by the command of the good King and great Reformer. Theſe that would ſee any further concerning ſome ſcruples about <hi>Pſalms</hi>-ſinging, let them read worthy Mr. <hi>Durhams</hi> Expoſition of the <hi>Song of Solomon,</hi> from <hi>page</hi> 48. to <hi>page</hi> 53. where they may find ſome doubts reſolved, which I purpoſely here omit, becauſe there they may be found, though little, or nothing here medled with, be there touched.</p>

                  <p>This Inſpirer of the <hi>Quakers</hi> is ſurely no Spirit of Truth, but a manifeſt Deviſer of Lies, ſeeing almoſt in every Sentence, that drops from his mouth, he impudently ſlanders the Church of God in <hi>Britain:</hi> for, who ever heard that any <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Church did hold any thing of Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitution formally as ſuch, for an Infallible Rule; But, on the contrary, it hath always been the Doctrine of all <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Churches, and as much of the Church of <hi>Britain</hi> as any other, (as may be ſeen in the fourth Article of the 31. Chapter of her Confeſſion of Faith) that all Synods and Councels ſince the Apoſtles days are liable to Error; and that therefore their Conſtitutions formally as ſuch, are not to be made the Rule of Divine Faith and Religious Practice: and yet there is much more hope of an unerring Spirit in a whole Synod of Orthodox Church-Guides, than in any Brainſick <hi>Quaker</hi> falſly pretending thereunto.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Quakers</hi> do not here quarrel with our Directory Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or Catechiſm as to their ſubject ſentence, and the particular definitions which they contain; or elſe, they ſhould have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced the particulars which they judge to be wrong, and not
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:56523:81"/>agreeable to the Stripture, (that we might have known what to vindicate) which until they do, I cannot gratifie them with par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular defences.</p>
                  <p>Their quarrel therefore here is at the very common form of a Directory, Confeſſion, or Catechiſm in a Church, and that Church-Guides ſhould preſume to Conſtitute theſe; and ſo all Churches are concerned in this affair, ſeeing all of them have their Confeſſions, Catechiſms, and Directories; and yet (no doubt) this quarrel is chiefly intended againſt the Directory, Confeſſion, and Catechiſm of the Church of God in <hi>Britain.</hi> Therefore, that we may in the general vindicate theſe, we ſhall begin with the Directory.</p>
                  <p>Therefore firſt, a Church-Directory may be taken in a large and improper ſence, as comprehending rules concerning parts of the publick Worſhip of God it ſelf, and the religious manner thereof, as their immediate object directly regarded; and if theſe Rules teach and direct no other Worſhip, nor any other religious manner of the Worſhip, but the very ſame which the Scripture directs and teaches, then they can never be found fault with, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing even every particular Miniſter hath authority, and is obliged by his Office to teach and enjoyn his Flock the Worſhip of God, and the religious manner thereof from the Scripture; yea, that is his chief work, and I muſt ſtill think, that a Synod of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters conveened in Chriſts name have no leſs authority, nor can be any leſs obliged. Such Rules there are in our Directory, as the Rules appointing the Sabbath-day to be kept holy, <hi>Pſalms</hi> to be ſung, Miniſters to do their work faithfully, diligently, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which are very Scripture-Rules particularly taught therein, and their immediate objects are conſtituent parts, or religious manners of the Worſhip.</p>
                  <p>But Secondly, a Church-Directory may be taken in a more ſtrict and proper ſence, as reſtricted to, and meerly comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rules, or Directions, concerning the External Circumſtances of the Publick Worſhip, and Government of Gods Houſe. And for vindicating our Directory, (in the general, as was explained) taken in this proper notion; We muſt obſerve firſt, that, as it is utterly impoſſible to exerce any action, except under the veſture of ſeveral circumſtances; So likewiſe the publick Worſhip of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:56523:81"/>God cannot be performed, except under the veſture of various Circumſtances, as needs no demonſtration.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I muſt obſerve that, as the veſture of unbeſeeming undecent, and diſorderly circumſtances in the exerciſe of Gods Publick Worſhip, doth very much deform and diſgrace the work, (as all may know) and ſo cannot but very much hinder Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and beget Scandals; So the Veſture of comely, decent, and orderly circumſtances therein, doth greatly beautifie and adorn the work, (by the Rule of Contraries) and ſo doth promote and advance Edification and Growth, which by the contrary are exceedingly letted and hindered.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I muſt obſerve, that theſe External Circumſtances of Gods Publick Worſhip, are not in the Scripture particularly defined and determined, ſeeing it is no where of Scripture par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly defined, what time of the day, or night the publick Worſhip ſhall begin; how long it ſhall laſt; what order ſhall be obſerved in reading, preaching, praying, ſinging, hearing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But only they are therein determined in the general, as to their common form of order and decency, that, decency and order muſt be obſerved therein, ſeeing all things muſt be ſo done in the Church, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.40.) which command is manifeſty tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed by the undecency and diſorder of one ſmall Circumſtance; and ſo it plainly injoyns to maintain order, and decency, in all the Circumſtances of Gods Publick Worſhip.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, I muſt obſerve, that it properly belongs to the Church-Guides, and, they are bound to ſee to the maintaining of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and order, in the Circumſtances of Gods Publick Worſhip: for, ſeeing God commands to maintain decency and order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and they are the Watchmen and Rulers who have the Care and Overſight of the Church, (<hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.8. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.12. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. and 5.17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.7, 17. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.2.) it muſt, of neceſſity, belong unto them, and they muſt be thereunto obliged.</p>
                  <p>Having obſerved theſe things, I hope, I may aſſert, that Church-Officers and Judicatures have Divine Warrant and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to make and ſet forth Church-Directories for regulating the External Circumſtances of Gods Publick Worſhip in a decent and orderly way, or ſo as they may be decent and orderly. This
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:56523:82"/>aſſertion is clear from our preceeding Obſervations, whereunto I ſhall add an Argument, or two.</p>
                  <p>Firſt therefore, God commands Church-Officers and Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catures, to maintain Decency and Order in the whole Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of his Publick Worſhip, (as is clear from our preceeding Obſervations) and yet he hath no where particularly condeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended upon, or defined theſe Circumſtances, as is before ſhewed alſo: Therefore, the Church-Officers and Judicatures have, certainly, Divine Warrant and Authority particularly to condeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend upon, define, and determine them. The Conſequence (which now only needs proving) is eaſily proved: for, ſeeing God hath commanded Church-Officers and Judicatures to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Decency and Order in theſe Circumſtances, and yet hath not himſelf particularly defined and determined them, either he hath given them Warrant and Authority particularly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine and determine the ſame, which is the thing we plead for; or elſe, he hath commanded them to maintain Order and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency in Circumſtances never to be defined or ordered; but left ſtill to be confuſed, undeſined, and unordered; and ſo they muſt do it by random and blind chance. Which is extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abſurd, ſeeing, ſo, he ſhould have commanded Contradictions, <hi>viz.</hi> order in Circumſtances never to be ordered.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Church-Directories rightly regulating the External Circumſtances of Gods Publick Worſhip; ſo that they may be decent and well ordered, according to the Scripture do conduce and contribute to ſet forward a Spiritual Good and Edification, as is moſt clear from our preceeding Obſervations: But, it's beyond all doubt, that Church-Officers and Judicatories have Warrant and Authority to do ſuch things as may conduce and contribute to ſet forward the Spiritual Good and Edification of the Churches of their Overſight; or elſe, they cannot have Warrant to do any thing: Therefore, ſure it is, Church-Officers and Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories have Authority and Warrant to make ſuch Directories, rightly regulating the External Circumſtances of Gods Publick Worſhip in the Churches of their Overſight.</p>
                  <p>Thou wilt (may be) ſay, that men can have no Authority to determine any part of Gods Worſhip not determined in the Scripture. Therefore men can have no Authority particularly to determine theſe Circumſtances not ſo determined in the Scriptures.</p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:56523:82"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Antecedent I willingly yield; but I utterly deny the Conſequence, ſeeing the things we now ſpeak of, and which alone are the immediate object of a Church-Directory in this ſtrict and proper acception, are no part of the Worſhip in their particular nature, but are meer External Circumſtances of that which is the Worſhip, as is evident from all before-ſaid.</p>
                  <p>Theſe common Rules made by Church-Authority according to the general Precepts and Rules of Scripture, do not of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves bind Conſcience; nor doth the Authority from whence they immediately proceed of it ſelf bind Conſcience; neither is their immediate object in its particular nature, any part of Gods Worſhip, as ſaid is. Nevertheleſs, they being formed according to the general Precepts of Scripture for Order and Decency, theſe bind Conſcience; and the general End of Edification it binds Conſcience; and Conſcience is alſo bound not to deſpiſe, but reverence lawful Church-Authority, it being Gods Ordinance, and we cannot contemn any of his Ordinances, and be guiltleſs; and therefore we may not in wilful conceit reject ſuch Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Church; albeit out of the caſe of Scandal-giving, and if it do not proceed from a contempt of Church-Authority, or from ſome unruly Humor of Spirit, we may upon cauſes juſt and reaſonable, lawfully ſometimes intermit and forbear the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of them. Theſe things I have ſaid to prevent Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections.</p>
                  <p>And hence, I hope, it appears, that Church-Officers have an Authority to Make and Conſtitute Church-Directories for order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the External Circumſtances of Gods Publick Worſhip, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the general Precepts of the Scripture; albeit I grant that ſuch Directories are not Infallible, and ſo of themſelves no Bond of Conſcience, nor Rule of Divine Faith.</p>
                  <p>As for our Confeſſion and Catechiſm, if the <hi>Quakers</hi> judge them to be unſound in any of their particular Definitions, when the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſhall inſtance them, it ſhall be time enough to make their Apology. But while they declare themſelves Enemies to the very common form of a Confeſſion and Catechiſm in a Church; herein they proclaim their Hoſtile mind againſt Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, their feeding of the Flock, and Edifying of the Body of Chriſt; ſeeing theſe Compendious Breviaries of the moſt funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental points of Scripture Doctrine and Chriſtian Principles,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:56523:83"/>do exceedingly conduce for a method of eaſier learning, and more diſtinct underſtanding of the ſame; and that partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their ſuccinct and compendious form, ſhortly repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to us, and quickly conducting and directing us to the moſt principal ſubſtance of the whole Scripture-Doctrine, which is methodically ſummed in them, and which by our own private Induſtry we could neither ſoon, nor eaſily diſtinctly gather out of the whole body of the Scriptures; and partly, becauſe of their greater Explication, each of their Definitions or Enunciations being the perſpicuous ſentence of many parallel Scriptures com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared together, and ſo by their Conſociated Beams and United Rays more powerfully Shining, like ſo many Stars and Lumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries placed together into one Conſtellation; and, laſtly, becauſe of their chained Conjunction, being united, placed, and joyned together in a diſtinct and continual method. Theſe things do very much contribute, not only to the more ſpeedy learning, but alſo to the more diſtinct underſtanding of the moſt neceſſary points of Scripture-Doctrine; and ſo of the reſt alſo, as having ſome connexion with, or relation unto theſe. And hence alſo theſe methodized Models of the moſt Eſſential Principles of Scripture-Doctrine wiſely formed from the Scriptures, are a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table mean to guard people againſt Deluſions and Errors which Corrupt Men, are continually broaching in the Church; ſeeing they being in that manner Succinctly and Methodically ſummed, and ſo quickly learned, and more diſtinctly underſtood, are, as it were, a Meaſuring Line in every ſerious Mans hand to find out the truth, or falſhood of every Mans Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>What? Ought not Miniſters, and have they not Authority to publiſh from the Scripture the Principles of Religion to the People? and that in the moſt perſpicuous and ready way they can? have they not Authority to feed the Flock and edifie the Body of Jeſus from his own Word in the neareſt method? and have they not Authority to furniſh and guard their People againſt damnable Deluſions, and Soul-ruining Errors in the moſt eaſie and ſucceſsful manner they can? If they have not Authority for, and be not bound to do theſe things, then they have not Authority for, nor are they bound to do any thing: Let all the <hi>Quakers</hi> in <hi>Britain</hi> anſwer but one mouthful of ſence to it, if Miniſters (whoſe Office muſt continue in the Church to the end of the World, and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:56523:83"/>till that day when all the Saints ſhall be compleatly perfected, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19, 20. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11, 12, 13.) be not given to the Church for the very forementioned ends, and if theſe be not the Incumbent Works of their Office. But it's vain to demand an anſwer which can never be found, or ſence from theſe who (Impugning Grammar) declare themſelves Enemies to Sence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeaking: And have not the <hi>Quakers</hi> alſo publiſhed a Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their black Faith, Entituled, <hi>The Principles of Truth, (viz. Per Antiphraſin;</hi> for they ſhould have ſaid, of Falſhood, Fiction, Error, Blaſphemy, and Calumnies) printed in the year 1668. and we have alſo ſeen ſeveral of their ſweet <hi>Catechiſms.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, ſay the <hi>Quakers,</hi> Is not the Doctrine of Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion as good in the Scriptures, as in any Confeſſion or Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yes, no doubt, but what of that? will that infer any thing againſt a Confeſſion or Catechiſm in a Church, whereby that good Doctrine of the Scriptures may be more ſpeedily and diſtinctly learned? I would rather think, that the better the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Scriptures is, the means contributing to our more ready and diſtinct learning thereof ſhould be the more uſeful and warrantable. So unfortunate are the <hi>Quakers,</hi> that their own Weapons turns upon themſelves. Obſerve, that this Objection of the <hi>Quakers</hi> (if it could have proved any thing at all) would have Militated as much againſt all Preaching, as againſt a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion or Catechiſm.</p>
                  <p>Hence, though the Scriptures be a better Book than any Confeſſion or Catechiſm in the World, as formally Conſtituted by Eccleſiaſtical Authority; yet a Confeſſion or Catechiſm are not therefore unlawful or unwarrantable in a Church, as, I think, is clear enough from what I have ſaid.</p>
                  <p>But, ſay the <hi>Quakers,</hi> Whether or not have ye an Infallible Spirit to give forth ſuch a Directory, Confeſſion, and Catechiſm as ye have done?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Hereby, the <hi>Quakers</hi> refuſe that any Man may direct according to the Scripture, the External Circumſtances of Gods Publick Worſhip, or that any Man may Catechize, or give an Account or Confeſſion of his Faith, (which every Man in due Circumſtances is bound to do, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 10.32, 33. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9, 10. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15.) but much more a Church; partly for
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:56523:84"/>ſatisfaction to other Churches; partly for diſtinguiſhing Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Churches from Heretical Synagogues; and partly for a ſhort and clear publick Teſt of the Principles of her own Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers) except he be Infallible, which any Man may ſee to tend to the baniſhing of all theſe Duties out of the World, ſeeing there is no Man now adays Infallibly Inſpired for ſuch things. But what great need (I pray) is there of Mens Infallibility in this Affair; They are not to aſſure their Doctrine from their own Infallibility, but from the Infallible Scripture: ſhall not that be ſufficient to aſſure it? I cannot but think ſo: To the Law, and to the Teſtimony then, inſtead of your Inſpired Parts.</p>

                  <p>Here is an obſcure Riddle, a dark Aenigma, which where to find the ſence of, is a little difficult; but, if it hath any ſence, they ſeem to Query, Whether or not our Juſtification, Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be the gifts of our Directory, Confeſſion, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſm, whereof they were laſt ſpeaking in the preceeding Query.

                  <p>I anſwer therefore to their preſent Queſtion, That our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, Sanctification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are the Gifts of God only, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32, 33. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.17.) and that the Queſtion is void of ſence, ſeeing the beſtowing of a gift is an action pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly relative to an Intelligent Being; for we do not receive
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:56523:84"/>gifts from Stocks, Stonee, or Brutes.

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:56523:85"/>their mind, that Church-Officers and Judicatories ſhould not give Obedience to Gods Commands, ſhould ſlight Order and Decency, and the Churches Edification. There is the new-coined Directory of the <hi>Quakers;</hi> let all Men judge if it be not an Inſtrument of the Devil.</p>
                  <p>But, for Anſwer to their Query, I ſay, That there are ſeveral Rules in our Directory, that materially conſidered, are very Scripture-Rules particularly delivered therein, (as I ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at the Survey of the Ninth Query) and it is evident that theſe are not another Goſpel, but are Inſtitutions of the ſame Goſpel preached by the Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>But ſecondly, taking our Directory in a more ſtrict and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per notion of a Church-Directory, as that is reſtricted to, and meerly contains Directions concerning the External Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the Publick Worſhip and Government of Gods Houſe; I muſt for Anſwer to their preſent Query concerning it, firſt ſuppoſe the particular Directions thereof to be materially right and conform to the Scripture general Precepts above mentioned, (which here once for all I warn) ſeeing I will not here ſtand to vindicate every particular Direction thereof in particular. If the <hi>Quakers</hi> had quarrelled any particular Direction thereof, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooved to have vindicated it particularly: but ſeeing they have held themſelves in the general, ſo muſt I.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things ſuppoſed, and taking our Directory in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid ſtrict notion, I anſwer, that our Directory thus taken, is not ſimply Goſpel, or Scripture-Rule, but partly Eccleſiaſtical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; it is Goſpel or Scripture-Rule in reſpect of its funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental ground and chief conſideration, which conſiſts in the Inſtitution and Rule for maintaing Order and Decency, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting Edification, ſeeing that is Scripture-Rule; it is Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical conſtitution in reſpect of the particular definition and accommodation of theſe Circumſtances, which is an Act elicited by the habit of Chriſtian Prudence, conform to the general Rules and Inſtitutions of the Scripture forementioned.</p>
                  <p>Hence it appears, that though the directions of our Directory thus taken, be not ſimply Goſpel-Rules, yet, neither are they ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Goſpel, ſeeing in reſpect of their fundamental ground and chief conſideration, they are Inſtitutions of the ſame Goſpel preached by the Apoſtles, (as is ſhewed) and in ſo far as they
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:56523:85"/>are Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitutions, they are warranted by the Goſpel preached by the Apoſtles, as in regard of particulars, I ſuppoſe, until the <hi>Quakers</hi> particularly quarrel, and in the general I have proved it above at the Survey of their Ninth Query. But ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Goſpel hath no warrant in the Goſpel preached by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, but is contrary thereunto, and condemned therein. Again, another Goſpel is ſome Doctrine beſide, or contrary to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel preached by the Apoſtles, urged as neceſſary to Salvation, and an abſolute bond of Conſcience and Rule of Divine Faith, and ſo a Doctrine in its matter only beſide, being thus urged becomes contrary. But our Church-Directory (beſide its agreement with the Scripture general Rules) was never ſo urged, as the Practice of our Church ſufficiently atteſts.</p>
                  <p>As for our Confeſſion of Faith and Catechiſm, I affirm, that albeit, as to the formal Conſtitution which they have from Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Authority, they be not Infallible, or Canonical; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe all Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitutions would be ſuch; yet, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering them Materially, as to the whole Articles confeſſed in the one, and the whole Definitions delivered in the other, (and for the queſtionary part it is no matter, ſeeing that affirms nothing, nor denies) they are univerſally, and throughout, very Scripture-Sentence, very Goſpel-Rule, and Law together, either expreſly and formally, or materially, implicitly, and by good conſequence, taught therein. Let the <hi>Quakers</hi> condeſcend upon any Article, or Propoſition believed or taught in the one, or the other, that is not either expreſly, or implicitly, and by good conſequence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Scriptures, which until they do, I muſt ſuperſeed particular Apologizing for them. Only I have already ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently defended them in the general, (according as they have impugned them) and ſo many of their particular Enunciations as the <hi>Quakers</hi> elſewhere in theſe Queries have particularly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached, I have alſo particularly maintained and vindicated in my Surveys. The <hi>Quakers</hi> then may ſee, that I affirm the whole Enunciations of our Confeſſion and Catechiſm materially taken to be very Goſpel and Law Rules together; and ſo they are not another Goſpel, ſeeing another Goſpel does not teach and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the ſame Truths, which the Goſpel preached by the Apoſtles does. And I have told them before, that as to their formal Conſtitution by Eccleſiaſtical Authority, they have not the ſame
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:56523:86"/>Authority which the Goſpel preached by the Apoſtles had, we do not equalize them therewith. Let the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſee to their own <hi>Confeſſion of Faith,</hi> (and a black Faith, I am ſure) wherein there is ſcarce a Sentence that is not contrary to the Goſpel preached by the Apoſtles, a good part of which we have already ſeen, and ſhall ſee more hereafter.</p>
                  <p>As for the Sentence of Scripture here Cited from the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> a man would wonder to what purpoſe it is here Quoted. But here is the buſineſs, the <hi>Quakers</hi> feign to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a ſort of a Dumb-Goſpel, without any words, or Orations, and this they ſeem to alledge to have a real and ſtrict Identity with the power of God; which is as ſenſeleſs a Dream as can well be faln upon, which the very Context of the place Cited over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws, while it calls the Goſpel the power of God to Believers only, intimating, that it is not ſuch unto unbelievers, on whoſe hearts it does not ſo powerfully work, whereas the power of God properly taken, is ſtill the ſame in reſpect of all the world.</p>
                  <p>The Goſpel is called the Word of Truth, and the word preached (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.2.) Which cannot be ſaid of the power of God. The Goſpel was committed to <hi>Pauls</hi> truſt (1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.4. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.11.) But the power of God was never committed to the truſt of any meer Creature.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle therefore calls the Goſpel the power of God by a Figure called <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> attributing the name of the Principal Cauſe to the Inſtrument, becauſe it is an effectual Inſtrument of the power of God. So the Preaching of the Croſs is called the power of God to them that are Saved (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.18.) not by way of Identity, but thus <hi>Synecdochically,</hi> as is declared. So alſo the <hi>Samaritans</hi> reputed <hi>Simon Magus</hi> the great power of God (<hi>Act.</hi> 8.10.) not by way of Identity (for, I think, they were not <hi>Quakers</hi>) but they called him ſo <hi>Synecdochically,</hi> becauſe in their conceit he was a great Inſtrument thereof.</p>

                  <hi>What is Original Sin? Whether it be not the Devil? yea; or nay? for doth not the Original ſignifie the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning?

               <div type="survey">
                  <head>S<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RVEY.</head>
                  <p>This Inſpirer of the <hi>Quakers</hi> (it ſeems) muſt be a great Jeſter; but, I think him a great Fool too, to ſuggeſt in his ſport ſuch Romances and Fictions unto ſimple Men void of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who, to his infamy and diſgrace, thus report them in Earneſt.</p>
                  <p>The Devil is indeed a very ſinful Creature; but that he ſhould be very Sin it ſelf is a horrible Fiction. For firſt then, Original Sin muſt be a Perſon, ſeeing the Devil is a Perſon. Secondly, God made the Devil: but God made not Original Sin, ſeeing he cannot be the Author of ſin: therefore Original Sin is not the Devil. The <hi>Minor</hi> is proved already: I prove the <hi>Major;</hi> God made all Creatures, otherwiſe they could not be Creatures: but the Devil is a Creature: therefore, certainly, God made him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If God made not the Devil, then the Devil is an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created Independent Being, (for a Being he is) exiſting from himſelf; and ſo there is not one, but two Uncreated Independent Beings, the one of them Eſſentially Good, the other Eſſentially Evil, being the very ſame thing with Sin, as the <hi>Quakers</hi> would, (which is the demented Ghoſt of old <hi>Manicheus,</hi> before the time ariſen from the dead:) but that is moſt abſurd Blaſphemy.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If Original Sin be the Devil, then the Original Sin of all Mankind was exiſtent before any Man had Sinned, and would have been to this day, though never Man had Sinned, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mankinds continuance in Obedience would not have deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Devils Being; but theſe things are ridiculous: and yet that which is aimed in this Query, hath been often ſaid by <hi>Quakers</hi> in my face and hearing.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, If Original Sin be the Devil, then there can be no Original Sin inherent in any Man, but we muſt be all born as Innocent and Spotleſs as ever <hi>Adam</hi> was Created; for, the Devil being a compleat Subſtantial Being, can never inhere as an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent into any other Subject. But, it's moſt falſe, that we have no Original Sin, but are born Innocent and Clean, which by theſe few Scriptures I prove, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. <hi>Death hath paſſed upon all
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:56523:87"/>Men, becauſe all have Sinned,</hi> but all have not ſinned actually, <hi>viz.</hi> Infants have not: Therefore it muſt be meant of Original Sin, ſeeing of one of the two it muſt be meant; or elſe the Apoſtle ignorantly miſtakes the reaſon why Death paſſes upon all Men, (<hi>viz.</hi> becauſe of Sin) but that cannot be ſaid, <hi>John</hi> 3.6. <hi>That which is born of the Fleſh is Fleſh,</hi> Job 4.14. <hi>Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? no not one, viz.</hi> naturally and in an ordinary courſe. Again, I have proved that God Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains Infants to be Baptized, which is given us for the Remiſſion of our Sins, as is ſhewed: Infants then muſt have Sin to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; otherwiſe there needed no Remiſſion of Sin: but they have no actual Sin: Therefore Original Sin. Again, <hi>Except a Man be born again, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God, John</hi> 3.5. But Infants, as well as others, partake of the Kingdom of God, as is before proved: Therefore there are Infants born again; and ſo they muſt, ſurely, be ſinful naturally, or elſe they could not be born again, or Regenerated. Again, <hi>David</hi> for the deeper ſence of his own Vileneſs, aſcends to the fountain, and ſource, of all the Evil and Uncleanneſs that he was liable unto, confeſſing that in iniquity he was formed, and in ſin his Mother conceived him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.5. where, what (I pray) would it have done to <hi>Davids</hi> deeper ſence, and further acknowledgment of his Vileneſs, (which, undeniably is his ſcope) that his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being in ſin, (as <hi>Pelagianizers</hi> have learned to anſwer) did conceive him ſpotleſs and without ſin? Nay, ſurely, the want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Original Sin would have made him to be the leſs vile, not the more; and beſide, it was his own Sin, not his Mothers which he came to confeſs: and again laſtly, <hi>We are by Nature Children of Wrath, (Epheſ.</hi> 2.3.) therefore by nature we muſt be ſinful, which muſt be Original Sin, ſeeing we have no other Sin by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that we are born in. The Conſequence is Infallible, ſeeing, we cannot be Children of wrath in that very reſpect, and under that very conſideration, in which reſpect, and under which conſideration, we are ſinleſs and pure: for then as we are ſinleſs and pure we ſhould be heirs of wrath, which is an abſurd Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy: and cannot ſtand with the juſtice of God to curſe a Man when he is Innocent: tell me not the inſtance of Chriſt Jeſus, who though he was altogether ſpotleſs in himſelf inherently, yet, he ſtood in our room as our Cautioner, and all our ſins were laid upon him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.6.</p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:56523:87"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pelagianizers</hi> anſwer us, that the Poſterity of <hi>Adam</hi> Sins only by Imitation, of their Predeceſſors. But Contrariwiſe, then we are only by Imitation, and not by Nature Children of wrath, (contrary to the Apoſtles Doctrine.) For we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not by nature be Children of wrath, and yet by nature be pure and ſinleſs. Secondly, I have ſhewed that Infants have ſin in them; but not by imitation (ſurely) ſeeing they are not capable to imitate therein: Therefore they muſt be ſinful by nature, not by imitation. Thirdly, if we were made ſinners only by Imitation, then ſome men might eſcape from that; for, we are not ſuch perfect Apes, as to imitate neceſſarily what we ſee in others. Laſtly, if <hi>Adams</hi> ſin be propagat to us only by Imitation, then we ſhall be made righteous in Chriſt only by imitation, of his righteouſneſs alſo. But the conſequent is utterly falſe: Therefore ſo is the antecedent from which it followes. The connexion of the <hi>Major</hi> (which only needs proving,) I prove from <hi>Rom.</hi> 5, 19. Where the Apoſtle declares that, <hi>as by one mans diſobedience many were made Sinners: ſo by the obedience of one, ſhall many be made righteous.</hi> Which compariſon requires ſome ſpecial proportion betwixt theſe members, ſo exactly compared, whereof there is ſcarce any ſhadow betwixt the imitation, and true and real Communication.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pelagianizers</hi> again anſwer that, though we be by nature corrupt, yet that corruption is not our ſin, but our affliction and puniſhment only. Contrariwiſe, as the habit, principle, and ſeed of grace is grace (and ſo alſo all habits are ſtill of the ſame nature with their acts) ſo alſo the ſeed and principle of ſin muſt be ſin. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23. is called the <hi>Law of ſin, Warring againſt the Law of the mind;</hi> and ſo its an enemy to grace, and the Image of God. <hi>Rom:</hi> 8.7. its called in the very abſtract (to ſhew its wicked nature) <hi>Enmity againſt God,</hi> and that <hi>it is not, neither can be Subject to this Law. Galat.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>it luſteth againſt the Spirit,</hi> and is contrary thereunto. Shall that then which is the ſource, principle, and ſpring of all our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſins; is enmity againſt God, his whole Image, and his Laws, and a contrary enemy to the Spirit; ſhall that (I ſay) not be ſinful? nay, then, ſurely, there is no ſin in the World, nor is it poſſible to render a definition of ſin, if that be not ſin.</p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:56523:88"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>George Keith (in his Quakeriſm no Popery, page</hi> 75, 76) an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers that our natural concupiſcence doth not infer any real guiltineſs upon us, nor makes us guilty of death, without our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual conſent thereunto, and (which is more ſtrange) that it doth not indwell in any, except where it is kindly received and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and, that therefore (which is his direct ſcope) our natural corruption is none of our ſin, untill we conſent actually unto it. But contrariwiſe, the Scripture (which I beleive much better) ſhews, that by the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> all were made ſinners, and guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of death (<hi>Rom.</hi> 5.16, 17, 18, 19.) and, that <hi>by nature we are Children of wrath (Eph.</hi> 2.3.) and ſo <hi>George Keith</hi> ſtraight contradicts the Apoſtle. Secondly <hi>Adam</hi> is not to be conſidered as a ſingle Perſon in the matter in hand, but (as the Scriptures laſt cited proves) as a Common undertaker for, and repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative head of all mankind; and ſo his deed in Law was the deed of all men, albeit they did not perſonally conſent, even as the Publick tranſactions, and deeds, of the repreſentatives of a Kingdome, State, or City, are in Law the fact and deed of all. Thirdly, <hi>George Keith</hi> who (as I am informed) did diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute once for a Profeſſors place, ſhould have remembred (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be ſaid of <hi>primo primi</hi>) that there are <hi>motus ſecundo primi,</hi> in us preceeding our actual conſent, which, when towards evil, are ſinful, as when a temptation is tampered with, or ſomewhat liſtened unto, though in end it be rejected and the conſent not given. Fourthly, gracious Principles, and gracious Inclinations are truly grace; or elſe a man is not gracious, though he be graciouſly principled and inclined: therefore ſinful principles and inclinations, (that is, principles and inclinations bending to ſin and evil) muſt be ſin (by the rule of Contraries) yea the worſt of ſin, being the bitter Fountain and Source of all the reſt. Fifthly <hi>George Keith</hi> grants (in the pages of his Book cited) that this natural Concupiſcence in men, is an evil thing, and inclines to evill and ſin (and ſo by a Metonymie, he allowes it to be called Sin.) Therefore it muſt be properly and formally ſinful, and not by a Motonymie only, ſeeing if it were not properly ſinful, it would not incline ſo; for grace cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to ſin; nor can that which is neither good, nor evil, or ſinful, incline more to evil, than to good.</p>
                  <p>That which he ſays of our natural Concupiſcence, its not
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:56523:88"/>indwelling without our actual conſent, and kindly reception; I cannot but think, he was in a ſtrange mixture, when he dropt it from his ill-inſpired pen. For I am ſure, St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays in a Text often handled (and by <hi>George Keith</hi> abuſed too, as ſhall after appear) that there was ſin and corruption dwelling in him when he hated it, diſallowed it, and gave no conſent thereunto, nor kindly reception, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7 <hi>Chap.</hi> from <hi>Ver:</hi> 15, to, 23. and, certainly, our natural Concupiſcence (which <hi>George Keith</hi> denys not to be in us, but there confeſſes, that it is (and it would be repugnant to be otherwiſe, as is clear) though he deny it to indwell in us, or to be our ſin, till we actually conſent to it) being an accident, muſt indwell into, and have union with ſome ſubject — of dependence, ſeeing it cannot exiſt without ſome vehicle, nor move one nails-breadth by it ſelf. In whom then dwels it, when it is not conſented unto? If he ſays, in the Devil (and he can ſay no other thing) then when he does not conſent unto it, he has the Devil and it both to lodge, ſeeing if it be Subjected and dwels in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, it cannot be in him without its Subject with it. And, in my opinion, he had better lodge it alone, as it and the devil too; for two ſuch Devils are worſe together, then any of them it ſelf Theſe are the dictats of a witty Inſpirer.</p>
                  <p>However, <hi>George</hi> here objecteth from <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 18, <hi>Chap: Ver:</hi> 4. where its ſaid, <hi>the Soul that ſinneth, it ſhall die.</hi> To prove, that, without an actual conſent, unto our natural Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence, we are not held guilty of death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> The whole Chapter is concerning, the ſins of neareſt Parents, as is clear by reading it, and ſo makes nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt original ſin, derived from our firſt Parent <hi>Adam.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the manifeſt ſcope of the Chapter, is to give aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to every man, of mercy upon his repentance and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God, whatever his Parents, or himſelf have been before. But will that infer, that ſuch a man, who findes mercy upon his Repentance, never had original ſin? O brave conſequence! again, there is not the ſame reaſon of <hi>Adam,</hi> and of our other nearer Parents; for he was our common repreſentative; not they; and therefore, we may be involved into his ſin, though not into theirs, before we were capable actually to conſent: for we do not ſtand and fall in any of them, but in him we did, as the Scriptures cited plainly proves.</p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:56523:89"/>
                  <p>But, having diſpatched <hi>George Keith,</hi> (albeit I will not ſtand upon all the objections here which are commonly brought, ſeeing, this Controverſie hath been much handled betwixt our Writers and the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> where it may be ſeen) they have one great Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection which I muſt anſwer, and that is, That if our Nature be Originally ſinful, that ſin muſt either be propagated by the Soul, or by the Body, or by both. Not by the Soul; for ſeeing God alone creats that, ſo God ſhould be the Author of Sin, which cannot be. Not by the Body; for ſo the Soul ſhould be free of it, ſeeing the Body being a dull thing, cannot propagate it into the Soul. Not by both, for the firſt reaſon given eſpecially.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Whatever way it be propagated, I have ſhewed from the Scripture that it is propagated, and therein we ought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce, though we could no ways comprehend the manner how it is propagated.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I anſwer, that there is not a ſufficient Enumeration of the Parts: for our Natural Corruption is neither Originally propagated into the Body, by the Soul, nor into the Soul, by the Body; but by our Impure Natural Generation into both, which is evident, ſeeing, abſtracting from, and laying aſide our Natural Generation, and our dependence thereby upon <hi>Adam,</hi> neither our Souls, nor our Bodies had been naturally infected with that Plague. It deſcends therefore, moſt clearly, by our Natural Generation, not unto the Soul alone, or the Body alone, but unto the whole Compound conſiſting of both united, which is the direct Effect of Generation, ſeeing it is not Souls, or Bodies ſeparated, but Men conſiſting of both united, that Men begets in their generative actions.</p>
                  <p>In the following part of the Query, they begin to uſe Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar againſt their Profeſſion. Original (ſay they) ſignifies the beginning; and therefore Original Sin muſt be the Devil, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth. A brave Conſequence indeed, which muſt ſtand upon the verity of this propoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> the beginning is the Devil; which, if they hold for truth, then they muſt ſay, that God Creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Heaven and Earth in the Devil, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 1.1.) and let them ſee to theſe Texts, (<hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.8.) where the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning is attributed to Chriſt; but I never heard it aſcribed Intranſitively, (as they call it) and in the Nominative Caſe unto the Devil, till now. <hi>Origo</hi> (for I have learnt my <hi>Latin</hi>) ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:56523:89"/>a Root, Birth, Fountain, as well as a beginning; why then may it not ſignifie (when the term Sin, is joyned with it) the Sin which we have from our Root of Mankind, <hi>Adam?</hi> or the Sin we are born in? or, which is the Fountain and ſource of the reſt? But let it only ſignifie a beginning, why may not Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Sin ſignifie the Sin of our beginning to come into the World? or, that Sin in us which is the beginning of the reſt?</p>
                  <p>For the laſt words of their Query, we muſt not think that Chriſt came to deſtroy or annihilate the Devils Entity and Being, (as the Adverſaries ſeem to mean) for the Devil is not dead yet; and the Scripture tells us, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 25.41, 46. <hi>Jud.</hi> 6.) <hi>That Hell Fire is prepared for him and his Angels:</hi> Chriſts coming therefore to deſtroy the Devil through Death, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14.) is meant of the deſtroying of his Power and Kingdom in the World, which yet will not be fully perfected until the Day of Judgment, as the Book of the <hi>Revelation</hi> throughly witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth.</p>

                  <p>This Inſpirer of the <hi>Quakers</hi> is either an ignorant Blockhead, or elſe a captious Sophiſter: for here we have a disjunctive Queſtion, or Problem propoſed by him in ſuch a manner, that whatever Member thereof we yield, we are abſurdly fanged: for, whether we ſay that Chriſt Died for all the Ungodly and Sinners in the World, that they ſhould live and dye in their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:56523:90"/>and Sins; or, whether we ſay that he Died for all the Ungodly and Sinners in the World, that they ſhould live to him, we ſtill ſpeak falſly and abſurdly too: for the firſt way, we ſhould ſay, that Chriſt Died for all theſe, that they might live and dye in their ungodlineſs and ſins, than which, nothing could be ſaid worſe; and the laſt way, we ſhould ſay, that Chriſt Died for all Men in the World, Elect, and Reprobate, which is alſo both falſe and abſurd. We muſt therefore purge the Queſtion from a Plurality of Interrogations, (which is the true vice of every Member thereof) and propoſe it thus. <hi>Whether did Chriſt Dye for all the Ungodly and Sinners in the World, or only for the Elect?</hi> That this is the true ſtate of their preſent Queſtion, their ſcope, and the reſt of the Query declares; albeit the Adverſaries either through ignorance could not, or for wickedneſs would not rightly propoſe it.</p>
                  <p>It is the known Doctrine of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> (with <hi>Arminians</hi> and <hi>Jeſuits</hi>) that Chriſt Died for all Men whatſoever, without exception, as alſo they do inſinuate in their <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> page 16. and 42. I ſhall not be prolix upon this Queſtion, or elſe I ſhould tranſgreſs my ſcope of Brevity: only I ſhall give a few clear Demonſtrations from the Scriptures, whereby it ſhall be evident, that Chriſt did not Dye for all Men whatſoever, Elect, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, but only for the Elect, and this is the Aſſertion.</p>
                  <p>Therefore firſt; for whomſoever Chriſt Died and ſhed his Blood, God loves them with a ſpecial love, yea, the greateſt meaſure of love: but he loves not ſo all Men whatſoever: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt did not Dye and Shed his Blood for all Men whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. The <hi>Major</hi> ſhall be evident by theſe plain and clear Scripture-Teſtimonies, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.9, 10. <hi>In this was manifeſted the love of God towards us, becauſe he ſent his only begotten Son into the World, that we might live through him: Herein is love, not that we loved Him, but that he loved us, and ſent his Son to be a Propitiation for our Sins,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.16. <hi>Hereby perceive we the love of God, becauſe he laid down his Life for us,</hi> Rom. 5.8. <hi>But God commendeth his love to us in that while we were yet Sinners, Chriſt Died for us,</hi> John 15.13. <hi>Greater love hath no Man than this, that a Man lay down his Life for his Friends.</hi> Theſe Scriptures make the <hi>Major</hi> as clear as Noon-day. The <hi>Minor</hi> is no leſs evident; for God had never any ſpecial love to
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:56523:90"/>any Reprobate, and eſpecially the greateſt meaſure of Love: <hi>Depart from me,</hi> (ſays Chriſt to Reprobates, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.23.) <hi>I never knew you, viz.</hi> with a knowledge attended with love; for, it is otherwiſe ſure that he was not ignorant of them; but the meaning is plain, that he never knew them with any ſpecial love or kindneſs for them, which way it is often meant in the Scriptures, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Jer.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Heſ.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Amos</hi> 3.2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. Again, theſe whom God ſo dearly loves he quickens them together with Chriſt, and makes them ſit in Heavenly places in him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.4, 5, 6. But he doth not theſe things to all Men whatſoever, as needs no proof.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Theſe for whom Chriſt Died, God freely with him beſtows all things upon them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. and it cannot be otherwiſe, as the Text plainly imports: but God does not beſtow all things upon all Men whatſoever, without exception; ſeeing he never beſtows any Saving Grace, Life Eternal, or Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry upon any Reprobate: Therefore, certainly, Chriſt did not Dye for Reprobates.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Theſe for whom Chriſt Died cannot come into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation: but all Reprobates come Eternally into Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the Adverſaries will not (I think) deny: Therefore Chriſt Died not for any Reprobate. I prove the <hi>Major</hi> from <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. where the Apoſtle Argues thus; <hi>Who is he that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth? It is Chriſt that Died, &amp;c.</hi> here the Apoſtle brings Chriſts Dying for a Man, as an Infallible Proof and Argument, that, that Man ſhall not come into Condemnation, but ſhall ſurely be juſtified; for ſeeing Chriſt hath Died for him, (ſays he) who then ſhall Condemn him. Now if Chriſt had Died for all Men whatſoever, <hi>Pauls</hi> Argument had been quite void, and utterly null, ſeeing the moſt part are, for all Chriſts Death, Eternally Damned; and the <hi>Arminians</hi> plainly contradict this Text, affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that Chriſt Died for Reprobates, who are Eternally Damned.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Chriſt did not Dye for theſe for whom he would not pray, ſeeing it's much leſs to pray for one, and to lend him but a good wiſh, than to Dye for him; nor can it be conceived, that he who will not beſtow a ſmall Intreaty for me, will ever beſtow his Life for me: But Chriſt would not ſo much as pray for all Men whatſoever, <hi>John</hi> 17.9. <hi>I pray not for the World,</hi> (ſays Chriſt) <hi>but for them which thou haſt given me:</hi> Therefore,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:56523:91"/>certainly, Chriſt did not Dye for all Men whatſoever, but only for the Elect whom God had given him out of the World.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, All whoſe iniquities Chriſt bare, (that is, Died for) ſhall ſurely be juſtified, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.11. But all Men whatſoever will never be juſtified, as will not be denied: Therefore, Chriſt did not bear the iniquities of, or Dye for all Men whatſoever. The <hi>Major</hi> is clear in the place cited, where the Prophet peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily and poſitively argues from Chriſts bearing of the iniquities of a Man, that therefore he ſhall juſtifie him; and he gives this as the ground, why he ſhall juſtifie many, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe He ſhall bear their iniquities; and ſo whoſe iniquities ſoever Chriſt bare, ſhall ſurely be juſtified; and that ſome whoſe iniquities Chriſt bare, ſhall not be juſtified, does utterly deſtroy and make void the Prophets Inference; and therefore it cannot be ſaid.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, For whomſoever Chriſt by his Death obtained Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with God, theſe much more he ſaves by his Life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. But all Men whatſoever are not ſaved by the Life of Chriſt, as the event proves: Therefore Chriſt did not by his Death purchaſe a Reconciliation with God for all Men whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, All for whom Chriſt Died, are by God appointed to obtain Salvation through him: <hi>God</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.9, 10.) <hi>hath not appointed us to Wrath, but to obtain Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Jeſus Chriſt who died for us;</hi> where the Apoſtle ſhews, that Chriſts Death is a mean appointed of God to procure the Salvation of theſe for whom he died; and ſo God intended the Salvation of all, for whom Chriſt died: but God never intended the Salvation of all Men whatſoever: Therefore, neither did Chriſt dye for all Men whatſoever. The <hi>Major</hi> is proved al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, nor do the <hi>Arminians</hi> deny it; but, on the contrary, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, That God did from Eternity intend the Salvation of all Men whatſoever, by an Antecedent Conditional Decree, as they call it. I prove the <hi>Minor:</hi> For firſt; If God intended the Salvation of all Men whatſoever, then all Men whatſoever would ſurely be ſaved, ſeeing whatſoever God purpoſes and intends, doth Infallibly come to paſs: <hi>God is in the Heavens, he hath done whatſoever he pleaſed,</hi> Pſal. 115.3. and 134.6. <hi>The Lord of Hoſts hath ſworn, ſurely, as I have thought ſo ſhall it come to poſs, as I have purpoſed ſo ſhall it ſtand,</hi> Iſai. 14.24. <hi>The Lord
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:56523:91"/>of Hoſts hath purpoſed, and who ſhall diſannul it?</hi> Iſai. 14.27. <hi>I will work and who ſhall let it?</hi> Iſai. 43.13. <hi>My Counſel ſhall ſtand, and I will do all my Pleaſure,</hi> Iſai. 60.10. <hi>The Counſel of the Lord, that ſhall ſtand,</hi> Prov. 19.21. But, it's moſt falſe that all Men whatſoever ſhall be ſaved, as needs no proof: Therefore, God never intended the Salvation of all Men whatſoever. Secondly, Many men are ordained to Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though juſtly to be incurred by them for their ſins firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, before they be condemned: Therefore, certainly, God hath not appointed all Men whatſoever to Salvation, ſeeing he cannot appoint, one and the ſame Man both to Salvation and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, and in good earneſt intend both to ſave and to damn one and the ſame Man. Nay, no Man of wiſdom can ſeriouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to do any thing upon a Condition, which he certainly knows will never come to paſs: For, How ſhall any Man of a ſound mind, ſeriouſly intend to do that which he, in the mean time, certainly knows he ſhall never do? Nay, this is impoſſible. The Antecedent is alſo manifeſt; <hi>For God hath made the wicked for the day of Evil,</hi> Prov. 16.4. God ſends many Men ſtrong De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions, that they may believe Lyes and be Damned; and ſo he intends their Damnation, (though not as the End; for that is the Glory of his Juſtice) 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.11, 12. <hi>and there are ſome Men who were before of old Ordained to Condemnation, Jud.</hi> 4. And what needs more? for whatſoever God doth within time, he from Eternity purpoſed and intended to do it; otherwiſe he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooved to do it, either againſt his intention and purpoſe; or elſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide his intention and purpoſe, that is, without having intended and purpoſed it, or its contrary; or elſe laſtly, he behooved to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the intention and purpoſe thereof within time; all of which are Blaſphemous and Repugnant, as needs no demonſtration: But it is moſt evident, that God within time condemns many Men for their Sins, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.32, 41. Therefore he from Eternity intended and purpoſed to condemn them; and yet they are juſtly damned for their ſins firſt committed, before they be condemned. I may not here ſtand to examine all the miſerable Evaſions, whereby <hi>Arminians</hi> and <hi>Jeſuits</hi> indeavour to Elude this Argument; otherwiſe this one Argument would ſwell into a Volume. But what is ſaid, may be ſufficient for ſuch as love truth, and for confounding of the Adverſaries, if the grounds here given be but rightly managed.</p>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:56523:92" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <p>Laſtly, All for whom Chriſt died are redeemed from the curſe of the Law, <hi>Galat.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle) <hi>from the Curſe of the Law, being made a Curſe for us,</hi> that is, being Crucified for us, as he there explains; and ſo Chriſt being made a Curſe, that is, his being Crucified for any Man, redeems that Man from the Curſe of the Law, according to the Apoſtle; and ſo if Chriſt was Crucified for all Men what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, then all Men whatſoever are, certainly, redeemed from the Curſe: but all Men whatſoever are not not redeemed from the Curſe: Therefore Chriſt was not Crucified, and did not Dye for all Men whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>But here the <hi>Arminians</hi> and <hi>Jeſuits</hi> meet us with their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary diſtinction, <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt hath not indeed by his Death redeemed all Men whatſoever from the Curſe Abſolutely; but that, for all that, he hath redeemed them from it Conditionally, <hi>viz.</hi> upon condition of their believing, which condition, becauſe all men whatſoever do not perform, therefore it comes to paſs, that all men whatſoever are not abſolutely Redeemed, but only theſe few who perform the Condition. But contrariwiſe, I cannot ſtand here to declare all the abſurdities that are wrapt up in this <hi>Jeſuitico-Arminian</hi> Evaſion, otherwiſe I ſhould exceedingly tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs my ſcope of brevity. Only for overthrowing this univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Conditional Redemption, I ſhall ſubjoyn two or three of the Arguments which our Divines moſt ordinarily bring againſt it. Therefore, for clearing the ſtate of the Queſtion, I grant, that the method and order of the application of the purchaſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption (taking it for the Price payed by the Mediator to the Juſtice of God) is Conditional, that is, it is applied to us upon Condition of Faith, either Actual, or (at leaſt) Seminal and Inclinative; yet, ſo as the Redeemer hath alſo by his Death pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed the Condition it ſelf to all the Redeemed, and in due time actually conferreth the ſame upon them. If this would ſatisfie our Adverſaries, we ſhould conſent, and the Controverſie were ended. But this is not the thing in Controverſie betwixt us: But the thing controverted betwixt them and us, is concerning Chriſts Dying it ſelf, and the very work of Redemption it ſelf, if theſe were performed Conditionally for all Men; and ſo if Chriſt Died for, and Redeemed all Men Conditionally. For example, a Man procures abſolutely a Pardon from the Prince
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:56523:92"/>for ſome Malefactor; but yet, he firmly reſolves that he ſhall never know of it, nor it be applied to him for his comfort, until by the perſuaſion of a Friend, who, he knows, will ſurely prevail with him, (this is the holy Spirit with Sinners) he come and own him for his Deliverer, and Saviour, who procured the ſame.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Arminians</hi> and <hi>Jeſuits</hi> affirm, That Chriſt Died Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally, though not Abſolutely, for all men, without exception. This we utterly deny, and though the Affirmer only be bound to prove his Affirmation, yet until they do that, I ſhall confirm our Negation. Therefore firſt, If Chriſt Died for and Redeemed Reprobates upon condition of their Believing, then God intended that; ſeeing Chriſt did not Dye for, or Redeem any man either againſt, or beſide Gods intention: But God never intended that Chriſt ſhould Dye for, or Redeem any Reprobate upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Believing; ſeeing ſo he ſhould have intended the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Reprobates, and that upon a condition which he infallibly foreſaw would never come to paſs, which ſort of Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot even befall any may of ſound mind; much leſs can it befall the Infinitly-Wiſe God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, According to this Doctrine whereby Chriſt is ſaid by his Death to have Redeemed all men whatſoever Condition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, Chriſt ſhall by his Death have purchaſed Redemption, upon condition of their Believing, for theſe who long before his Death were already actually damned in Hell, for whom there was no place left for Redemption; which is extreamly abſurd, that a price ſhould be exacted from the Redeemer for theſe who them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were then Suffering, and Eternally, without hope, to ſuffer the Vengeance of Eternal Fire for their Sins. This cannot ſtand with Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If Chriſt hath Redeemed Reprobates Conditionally, then the performance of the Condition, <hi>viz.</hi> Believing, is either in their own power, or elſe it is a gift of God, (whether pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by Chriſts Death, or by God beſtowed, without being thereby purchaſed, all is one to our preſent Argument.) It is not in their own power, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.44. and 15.5. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Philip</hi> 1.29. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. If then the Condition be a gift of God, then God either beſtows it upon Reprobates, or not: if he doth, then he either beſtows it upon them Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, or elſe Conditionally; if Abſolutely, then Reprobates
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:56523:93"/>ſhall thereby be made believers, and ſo be ſaved, ſeeing (as is ſuppoſed) God doth Abſolutely beſtow ſaving Faith upon them; if Conditionally, then, ſeeing Faith is the condition (by the Adverſaries own principles) the ſence hereof, will be, that God beſtows Faith in Chriſt upon Reprobates, upon condition that they firſt, have Faith in him; which is both nonſenſe and it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo implies a contradiction that they ſhould believe when they have no Faith, as is ſuppoſed. If then, God doth not beſtow Faith upon Reprobates, then, they cannot be ſaid to be redeemed; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, their Redemption (as is clear, from what is now ſaid) depends upon a Condition, which is neither in their own power, nor yet doth God beſtow it upon them; and ſo, it is, utterly impoſſible for them ever to perform. And will any Man, ſay, that a Man is Redeemed, when yet, his Redemption is not made ſo much as poſſible to him? his Redemption is upon the ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and grounds now laid down as impoſſible for him, as when a Man ſays, if ye will bring down the Stars, I will give you my Daughter, the Marriage with his Daughter is impoſſible. How then comes it to be a thing actual, when yet it is impoſſible? I confeſs that object would be worth the ſeeing, that were at once actual, and yet impoſſible.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, if Chriſt by his death Redeemed all men whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, only upon Condition of believing, and otherwiſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed them not, then he by his death Redeemed only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and none elſe, as is manifeſt: But all men whatſoever are not believers: therefore Chriſt did not by his death re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem all men whatſoever, from the Adverſaries own principles; and yet, they contend that Chriſt by his death Redeemed all men whatſoever; and ſo they directly contradict themſelves, and their univerſal Conditional Redemption is repugnant.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, (for I will ſtand no longer, upon a negative eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially) if Chriſt died for all men whatſoever, (give it what name they will) then he ſatisfied Juſtice, for all mens ſins whatſoever: But, the Conſequent is moſt falſe and abſurd: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo is the antecedent, from which it follows. The falſhood of the Conſequent, and its abſurdity are obvious: for if Chriſt ſatisfied Juſtice for all Mens ſins whatſoever, then, all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates are moſt unjuſtly Condemned, Seing their ſins for which they are Condemned, are by Chriſt ſatisfied for; and ſo
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:56523:93"/>their Condemnation is, an Act of great injuſtice, done both to Chriſt and them, which cannot be charged upon God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out extream Blaſphemy. I Prove the Connexion of the <hi>Major,</hi> becauſe, the very immediate end and Intention of Chriſt, dying for any Man, was to ſatisfie Juſtice for his ſins, as appears from <hi>Iſaia.</hi> 53, 8, 9, 10. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26, 28. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4, 25. and 5, 9, 10, 2, <hi>Cor.</hi> 5, 21. <hi>Galat.</hi> 3, 13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.26, 28, and 10, 12. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2, 24. In all which places, it is manifeſt that for whomſoever Chriſt died, he died, to ſatisfie Juſtice for their ſins: for, it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly aſſerted in theſe Texts, that, <hi>He was ſmitton for their Tranſgreſſions; made his Soul an offering for their ſins; Shed his Blood for the Remiſſion of their ſins; reconciled them to God, by his Blood; was delivered to die for their Offences; was made ſin for them; was made a curſe for them, to deliver them from the curſe; appeared to put away their ſin, by the Sacrifice of himſelf; Offered himſelf a Sacrifice for their ſins; bare their ſins in his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy on the Tree.</hi> All which, declares, that for whomſoever Chriſt died, he died to ſatisfie Juſtice for their ſins.</p>
                  <p>If they Anſwer, that Chriſt ſatisfied for all Mens ſins what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, upon condition of their beleiving, (as they uſe) and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe not. Unto this I ſhall ſubſume, that not all Men what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever beleive, but only ſome Few: Therefore, from the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies own principles, he did not ſatisfie for all Mens ſins whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, but only for believers ſins, and none elſe; and ſo their principles involves a Contradiction, <hi>viz.</hi> he ſatisfied for all Mens ſins whatſoever (ſay they) and yet, from theſe ſame very principles, he did not ſatisfie for all Mens ſins whatſoever, but only for believers ſins.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, ſeeing misbelief is a chief and Mother-ſin, Chriſt hath ſurely ſatisfied for it alſo, amongſt the reſt, for all, for whoſe ſins he did ſatisfie; otherwiſe he could not at all, have Redeemed them from the curſe, if he had left any of their ſins unſatisfied for; and ſo, if Chriſt died and ſatisfied for any Man, that is, for all that, Condemned, then ſtill that Man, is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for that, which yet is ſatisfied for, which is an Act of extream injuſtice. What? did not Chriſt ſatisfie for all their ſins, for whom he ſatisfied? if not; how came he to ſatisfie for a part, and not the reſt? and how are they ſaid, to be Redeemed by a partial ſatisfaction, which cannot Redeem any Man? and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:56523:94"/>who ſhould ſatisfie for the reſt, of their ſins? If then, (which is certain) Chriſt ſatisfied for all their ſins, for whom he did ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie, and ſo for their misbelief, among the reſt, I would gladly know, if Chriſt ſatisfied for all Men whatſoever, for what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates are Condemned: for it cannot, without the greateſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice be, for their ſins, which (as is ſuppoſed) are all ſatisfied for: misbelief and all. I cannot ſtand no longer upon this. But who ſo pleaſes may ſee this univerſal Conditional Redemption, very ſolidly, and yet very breifly Confuted in worthy Mr. <hi>Durhams</hi> Expoſition of the Book of the <hi>Rev.</hi> from pag. 299 the pag. 326.</p>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> By the whole World, <hi>John</hi> does not mean all Men what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, without exception; but his meaning is, that Chriſts death was not only a Propitiation for the ſins, of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and Men of their Nation, but alſo of the Nations of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole World; and for that cauſe, he calls it the whole World, becauſe the benefit of Chriſts death, was not any more reſtricted, and limited, to the Nation of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> with their few Proſelyts, as it was before, but was extended, to any Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on throughout the World, as well as to them.

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> If they will have this Scripture to be meant of all men whatſoever, without exception, it will prove that all men what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall be made eventually to live in Chriſt: for the ſence of this Text is plainly eventual; (<hi>They ſhall be made alive in Chriſt,</hi> ſays it) But the Adverſaries themſelves know that all men whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever are not made eventually alive in Chriſt; and ſo they cannot urge this Text, as meant of all men whatſoever, but only of theſe who eventually are made partakers of Life. The meaning thereof is, That all that Dye, Dye in <hi>Adam,</hi> and he by his fall is the Author of their Death; So all that again get Life, they get it in Chriſt, and he is the Author thereof unto them, ſeeing out of him there is no Life, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.12.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They object, That Chriſt <hi>is the Saviour of all Men, eſpecially of them that believe,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. Therefore Chriſt Died for all men whatſoever. The Text cited, (for anſwer) is meant only of Gods general providence, which he hath over all men in this Life, in preſerving them, and providing for them, which is chiefly extended towards Believers; otherwiſe in the ſence of the Adverſaries, who mean it, (by the objection) of Eternal Salvation, it will prove, that all men whatſoever are Eternally ſaved, eſpecially Believers, which, I am ſure, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries will acknowledge to be falſe, and abſurd too.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, They object, That if <hi>Adam</hi> hath loſt more than Chriſt hath reſtored, then <hi>Adam</hi> was ſtronger than Chriſt, which is moſt abſurd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> This Argument endeavours to prove, that the number of them that are eventually ſaved, is greater than of the eventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally damned, contrary to the Scriptures, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 7.13, 14. and 20.16.) for as long as the number of the eventually loſt is more than that of the ſaved, <hi>Adam</hi> hath ſtill loſt more, than are by Chriſt reſtored. Secondly, Chriſts Death was indeed ſufficient to have expiated the ſins of all men, and to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored all that <hi>Adam</hi> loſt; but it was not appointed to expiate all mens ſins whatſoever, but only of the Elect; and ſo the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment reaches not that which it aims at. Laſtly, It is an act of much greater power, to quicken one dead man, than to kill many Millions of living men; for, <hi>Adam</hi> was able to deſtroy many Millions, but not to reſtore one man; and ſo ſtill the Conſequence comes ſhort.</p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:56523:95"/>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>God will have all men to be ſaved,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. Therefore Chriſt died for all men whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Apoſtle by all men, means not of all men whatſoever; but of all Sorts, Ranks, and Degrees, of men, as the word, <hi>all,</hi> is frequently in the Scripture underſtood, as I partly before ſhewed, and as it is expreſly explained, <hi>Revel.</hi> 13.16. and ſo the word, <hi>all,</hi> is meant of <hi>Genera ſingulorum,</hi> that is, all kinds of Men; Not of <hi>Singula generum,</hi> that is, every Individual man. An anſwer of the ſame kind may be given, to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection which they draw from <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. where we have it turned, <hi>Chriſt taſted Death for every Man.</hi> But, the truth is, there is no more in the Original in this Text, but that Chriſt taſted Death for all, [<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>] and the word, Men, is not in the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; and ſo it may be as well ſupplied in our Language with the word Elect, or Believers, as with the word, Men; or, albeit it be ſupplied with the word, Men, yet, it muſt be underſtood as is ſaid, of men of every Sort, Station, Condition, Calling, Quality, and Degree; not of every Individual Man, ſeeing by our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Arguments, that would be utterly falſe.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, We are forbidden to deſtroy him for whom Chriſt Died, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 14.15.) and again, there are ſome (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1.) that deny the Lord that bought them: Therefore Chriſt Died for ſome, who for all that, may be deſtroyed and damned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Apoſtle in the firſt cited Text means plainly of laying a ſcandal before a weak Brother, (of whom he there ſpeaks) whereby we deſtroy him, as much as in us; and gives him an occaſion and temptation to deſtroy himſelf, if that could be; but it is not meant that any for whom Chriſt Died, do, or can eventually periſh; yea, in that ſame Chapter, (<hi>Ver.</hi> 4.) the Apoſtle expreſly ſays the contrary, where he confidently affirms, That <hi>he ſhall be holden up.</hi> The ſecond place cited, does not mean of theſe mens being bought and redeemed from Hell; but of their being bought, redeemed, or delivered from the ignorance of the World in a Moral, or Hiſtorical ſence through ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Illuminations; and from the external pollutions of the World through ſome common Operations; from all which they did once ſeem to the Church to be alſo bought and redeemed from Hell, and were ſo in her Judgment of Charity, according to which reſpects the Apoſtle there ſpeaks, moſt part whereof may
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:56523:95"/>be ſeen in that ſame Chapter, (<hi>Ver.</hi> 18.20.21.) where the Apoſtle ſays, That theſe men had eſcaped the Error of the World, and the Pollutions thereof, and had got ſome knowledge of the way of Righteouſneſs, <hi>viz.</hi> an External, Moral, and Hiſtorical knowledge: and the reſt of it is declared by <hi>John,</hi> (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.19.) where the Apoſtle ſays, That ſuch Perſons (of the ſame ſort that <hi>Peter</hi> here ſpeaks of) went out from them, that they might be made manifeſt, but were not of them; where he teaches, that theſe never were of the number of the truly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed; but that before their Apoſtaſie they were not diſcerned from them, and had the ſame Judgment of Charity with them.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, The promiſes of the Goſpel are univerſal to all: Therefore Chriſt Died for all men whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> They are univerſal to all Believers, <hi>(Whoſoever believes ſhall be ſaved)</hi> not unto all men; it's no where ſaid, whoſoever is a man ſhall be ſaved.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, They object, That except Chriſt have died for all men whatſoever, many to whom the Goſpel is preached, and are exhorted to Believe, ſhall have nothing that they can Believe; or if they believe, they ſhall believe a falſhood: But theſe things are abſurd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is falſe, that they ſhall have nothing to Believe; for they ſhall have to believe, that <hi>Chriſt is a ſufficient Saviour able to ſave to the utmoſt, all that come unto God by him, (Heb.</hi> 7.25.) and, that he will alſo ſave all that come to God by him, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 3.36. and 5.24. and 6.37.47.) and ſo they have alſo to believe, that Salvation is offered to themſelves in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and that they ſhall ſurely be ſaved, if they will receive and embrace Chriſt as he is offered in the Goſpel; and while they believe theſe things, they ſhall believe no falſhood, but a moſt certain and ſure truth. And if thereupon they ſhall flee unto Chriſt for refuge, and reſolutely cleave unto him, it ſhall be a clear evidence to them, that they are of the number of theſe for whom Chriſt died, ſeeing no Reprobate did ever truly flee unto Chriſt as his only Refuge, and cordially adhere unto him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.26.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, They object, That every man is bound to believe, that Chriſt died for him: Therefore Chriſt died for all men whatſoever, ſeeing we cannot be bound to believe falſhoods and lies.</p>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:56523:96"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> I utterly deny the Antecedent, ſeeing many in the world never had any means to hear of Chriſts Death, who therefore are not bound to believe ſo much as that he died for any man, ſeeing no man is bound to believe that which was never held forth unto him, nor could he in any Moral diligence know of.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Neither are all who hear and profeſs the Goſpel bound to believe that Chriſt died for them, but only ſuch as have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced Chriſt on his own Goſpel-terms, whoſe Faith in Chriſt and Repentance towards God are Infallible evidences, that Chriſt hath Died for them. Nor can there be any thing more abſurdly ſaid, than that every man, even that hears the Goſpel preached, is bound to believe that Chriſt died for him, whether he have embraced Chriſt, or not: for, then every man that hears the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel ſhould be alſo bound to believe, that he ſhall be ſaved, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he embrace Chriſt, or not; ſeeing for whomſoever Chriſt Died, he alſo ſaves them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. and 8.32. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.9, 10.</p>
                  <p>Thou wilt ſay, Why then are theſe for whom Chriſt Died not, Exhorted to believe in Him?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> They are not exhorted to believe, that Chriſt died for them, except they ſhall firſt make choice of, and embrace him for their Lord and Saviour, as the Goſpel offers him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They are exhorted to believe in Chriſt, or to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of him as their alone Lord and Saviour, upon his own terms to ſhew them what is their Duty, and to make them without excuſe, in that there was ſo much pains and means beſtowed upon them to ſhew them their Duty, and the way to Salvation; and yet they would not obey and embrace, but rejected the Mercy of God and Life Eternal, when it was offered to them upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of their believing in Chriſt Jeſus. But thou wilt ſay, They cannot believe in Chriſt: How then can they be unexcuſable for not doing it? ſeeing they could not help it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> But it's their own fault, that they cannot believe in him, their inward ſinful Corruption is the cauſe thereof.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They are unwilling, as well as unable; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are capable enough to become unexcuſable; ſeeing they are both unwilling, and it's their own fault that they are unable.</p>

                  <hi>What makes a Believer?

                  <p>It is one of the chief Articles of the <hi>Quakers</hi> Creed, that all men whatſoever are ſufficiently enlightned for Converſion and Salvation, (as their <hi>Confeſſion</hi> alſo aſſerts, <hi>pag.</hi> 5, 15, 16, 32, 33, 34.) as alſo, that they have ſufficient Grace to be Converted and Saved, <hi>Quakeriſm no Popery,</hi> pag. 66, 67, 68, 69, 71. Therefore I ſhall divide this Survey into two Sections; the firſt concerning Univerſal Light, the ſecond concerning Univerſal Grace.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>The Queſtion here is plain, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether or not there is a ſufficient Light, for Converſion, and Salvation, in all men whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, without exception? The <hi>Quakers</hi> affirm, that there is, I deny it; and albeit the Affirmer is ſtill obliged to prove, not the Denier; yet, I prove my Negative.</p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:56523:97"/>
                  <p>Therefore firſt, <hi>The Natural Man does not diſcern, neither can he know the things of the Spirit of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.14. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Natural Men are not ſufficiently enlightned for Converſion, or Salvation. The <hi>Quakers</hi> expound this Text, ſometimes of the unrenewed part in a Man, and ſometimes of Natural Reaſon, which (ſay they) is here meant by the Natural Man. But Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, it is plain, that <hi>Paul</hi> does there compare diſtinct Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Men. Secondly, I appeal the Analogy of Faith, for this their Figurative Gloſs. Thirdly, Though we give them their own Gloſs, they profit nothing, ſeeing many, yea, moſt of men, are not renewed, and have no other Light, but of Natural Reaſon, being deſtitute of the Spirit, and not having the light of the glorious Goſpel ſhining in unto them; (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3, 4. <hi>Jud.</hi> 19.) and ſo theſe men cannot diſcern Spiritually, or with a Spiritual evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, ſeeing a Spiritual act cannot be produced, without a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Principle proportioned thereunto, more than a Horſe can produce acts of Reaſon; for, nothing can act above it's Sphere and Capacity.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There are many in the World that are covered with groſs darkneſs; Many have their underſtanding darkened, and are alienated from the Life of God through the ignorance that is in them, becauſe of the blindneſs of their hearts, (<hi>Iſai.</hi> 60.2. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.18.) Believers themſelves in their unrenewed ſtate were under the power of darkneſs, (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.13.) and even within the pale of the Viſible Church, there are many to whom it is not given to know <hi>the Myſteries of the Kingdom of God;</hi> and God hath not given them a Heart to perceive, Eyes to ſee, nor Ears to hear, but their Eyes are ſhut that they cannot ſee, and their Hearts that they cannot underſtand, there is a Vail thereupon, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 13.11. <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.4. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 44.18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.7, 8.) Are theſe then ſufficiently enlightned for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion and Salvation? then black ignorance, blindneſs, and darkneſs, ſufficiently enlightens.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Quakers</hi> reply in their <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> (page 8.) That it is not the brain-knowledge that is blinded in any man, but only the ſenſible knowledge of feeling. But the reply ſignifies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, I inquire, if the brain-knowledge, without the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible knowledge of feeling, be ſufficient to Salvation? if it be,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:56523:97"/>then they who are quite ſtupid, and have no conſcience or ſence of ſin at all, but are paſt feeling, (as it is 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.19.) are ſufficiently enlightned to Salvation, which I do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. If then, the brain-knowledge alone, without ſomewhat of the other, be not ſufficient to Salvation, then (with the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries own grant) all men whatſoever are not ſufficiently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned to Salvation, ſeeing they grant the ſenſible knowledge of feeling to be blinded in many.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, All men have not even the brain-knowledge of Chriſt Crucified, and the New Covenant, as is clear in experience, (for, How many <hi>Americans</hi> and others can tell us one word of Chriſt?) and the Scriptures alſo declares it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.20. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. and 15.20.21. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.12. how then are ſuch men utterly ignorant of Chriſt, and ſo of the way to Salvation, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 14.6. <hi>Act.</hi> 4.12.) and are not within the Covenant, (as Believers Children are, who though they be not capable of actual know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, yet they belong to the Covenant) but are Strangers to the Covenants of Promiſe, and Aliens to the Church of God, (<hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12.) How (I ſay) are theſe ſufficiently enlightned to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? If theſe be ſufficiently enlightned thereunto, then not a ſmall whiſper of Chriſt or the Covenant can be needful. And, I am ſure, if they never heard of Chriſt, they can neither know Him, believe in Him, love Him, nor obey His Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, There are many, even who have heard of Chriſt, that, inſtead of brain-knowledge, are given up to ſtrong brain-Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, to believe black Errors and Lies, that bring on their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Damnation, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.11, 12. It is therefore moſt falſe, that the brain-knowledge is not blinded in any man.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Quakers</hi> here object from <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9. where it's ſaid, That Chriſt enlightens every one that comes into the World, which they expound of a Light ſufficient to Salvation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> I deny their Expoſition, which they ſhall never prove; for, the Text only ſays, That he enlightens every one that comes into the World, which indeed is moſt true in regard of whatſoever kind, or degree of Light any man in the whole world hath; for, every man is enlightned with ſome kind of Light, <hi>viz.</hi> either the Light of Natural Reaſon; or elſe, both with that, and the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Light of Grace alſo, all which they have from Chriſt, who is the Eternal Son of God, by whom all things were made,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:56523:98"/>(<hi>John</hi> 1.3. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2.) and is alſo our Spiritual enlightner; (<hi>Matth.</hi> 11.27. <hi>John</hi> 1.16, 17. and 8.12. and 12.46.) But that he enlightens every man that comes into the World, with a light ſufficient to Salvation, is neither ſaid in this Text of <hi>John,</hi> nor any where elſe of Scripture; but is, on the contrary, therein ſtrongly contradicted, ſome few Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies whereof I have produced. That which the <hi>Quakers</hi> add here, <hi>viz.</hi> That he enlightens every man that comes into the World, <hi>That all men through him might believe,</hi> is not ſo written in the Text, but only in the Seventh Verſe there preceeding, it's ſaid, That <hi>John</hi> bare witneſs of the Light, <hi>That all men through him might believe;</hi> but the truth is, the word, <hi>men,</hi> is not in the Original, but only the word, <hi>all,</hi> which may be as well ſupplied with the word, <hi>Elect,</hi> as the word, <hi>Men;</hi> and albeit it were in the Original, yet (for the reaſons before given) it behooved to be underſtood of all Sorts, Stations, and Degrees of Men, (or <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nera ſingulorum</hi>) not of every Individual Man, (or <hi>Singula ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerum</hi>) and ſurely, <hi>Johns</hi> witneſs was neither then, nor yet is come, to every mans ears in the whole World.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It uſes to be objected, That, that which may be known of God, was manifeſt to the <hi>Gentiles, Rom.</hi> 1.19. Therefore, even the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were ſufficiently enlightened.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> The knowledge that the Apoſtle there ſpeaks of, was only a natural knowledge of God, from the light of Natural Reaſon, and the works of Creation, (which was common with them to the Devil) and therefore was no ways ſufficient for Salvation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering alſo how ſmall a portion we have retained of it ſince the Fall; albeit it is indeed ſufficient for conviction, and to make un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable. They ſhould therefore prove, that theſe knew God in Chriſt, or God, as Redeemer, and his new Covenant, or elſe they profit not.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They object, That the <hi>Gentiles</hi> had a light in their Conſciences, accuſing, or elſe excuſing them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> If that light of a Natural Conſcience, which the <hi>Gentiles</hi> had, be ſufficient to Salvation, (as the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſtrongly inſinuate in their <hi>Confeſſion of Faith,</hi> pag. 6, 15, 16, 32, 33, 34.) then the Devil alſo, who wants not the Light of a Natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, is ſufficiently enlightened to Salvation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If that light of a Natural Conſcience, which the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:56523:98"/>
                     <hi>Gentiles</hi> had, be ſufficient to Salvation, then the meer light of Nature and Reaſon, and that when it is corrupted and darkened, without the Supernatural light of Grace, or ſo much as one Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promiſe, (which the <hi>Gentiles</hi> knew not) is ſufficient to Salvation; which, who ſays, is a deep-dyed Atheiſt. They ſometimes have ſaid to me, That the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were ſufficiently enlightned, even in reſpect of the Covenant of Grace, when it was manifeſted to <hi>Adam,</hi> or any other of their fore-Fathers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> We were once ſufficiently enlightned in <hi>Adam,</hi> in order to the Covenant of Works; but we are not ſtill ſo now, our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is darkened by the Fall: But, in reſpect of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, <hi>Adam</hi> was never our head and undertaker, and ſo his enlightning is nothing to us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Will their fore-Fathers enlightning at a great diſtance of time, worn out, and extinct, prove, that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> had ſtill a ſufficient light? Nay, then, let them prove, (for it's as eaſie) that a blind man ſees ſufficiently to read, becauſe, his Father who had Eyes, ſaw to do it; or, that all men are ſufficiently innocent, and able to do their Duty perfectly, becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> was once ſo, and then we ſhall need no Saviour.</p>
                  <p>But, Say the <hi>Quakers,</hi> is not the light then ſaving, which he believes?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Chriſt Jeſus, who is meant in the Scriptures, pointed at, (<hi>viz. Joh.</hi> 1.9. and 8.12.) is indeed a ſaving light; but the light of Nature and Reaſon, which is the only light that is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally in all men, (as was proved at the Survey of the fourth Query) is not ſo.</p>

                  <head>SECT. II. <hi>Concerning ſufficient Grace in all Men.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>The Queſtion here is, Whether there be ſufficient Grace in all Men, <hi>Turks, Pagans, Heathens, &amp;c.</hi> able to convert them, and ſo ſave them? The <hi>Quakers</hi> boldly affirm, that there is; and they do not mean of objective Grace, or Grace offered only to all, (which ſome plead for, right, or wrong, my preſent purpoſe is not concerned) but of ſubjective Grace, whereby the will is
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:56523:99"/>made able, and put into Hapacity and freedom to convert and turn to God, as <hi>George Keith</hi> affirms in his <hi>Quakeriſm no Popery,</hi> page 66. But I utterly deny, that there is Grace in all men ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for Converſion; and though ſtill the Affirmer ought to prove, not the Denyer, yet I prove my Negative.</p>
                  <p>Therefore firſt, There is not ſufficient light for Converſion in all men, as is proved: Therefore, neither is there ſufficient Grace in all men for Converſion. The Conſequence is eaſie, ſeeing Grace without Light, will be very blind Grace; nor can the will be renewed, and the underſtanding left unrenewed, and in darkneſs; for, how then ſhall it behave, ſeeing, <hi>Nil volitum quin praecognitum, ignoti nulla cupido.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Every ſufficient Cauſe is able to produce the Effect; or elſe, it is no ways ſufficient, as is palpable. But there is no Grace in Reprobates and Unrenewed Men, able to convert them, ſubdue the reſiſtance of their will, and bring it in ſubjection to God: Therefore there is not a ſufficient Grace to Converſion in them. The <hi>Minor</hi> only needs proving, and I prove it, becauſe the Natural Man cannot, by any aſſiſtance, diſcern the things of the Spirit, and the carnal mind, which is enmity againſt God, cannot by any aſſiſtance, be—ſubject to his Law, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7.) Nay, he muſt be a Spiritual man that does either, ſeeing a Spiritual act can never proceed from a Natural or Carnal Principle, more than a Horſe can make a Syllogiſm, or define an Object: But Reprobates and Unrenewed men are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely Natural Men, and Carnal minded. Therefore there is no Grace in Reprobates and Unrenewed Men, whereby they can either diſcern the things of the Spirit, or to be—ſubject to his Law; and ſo, I am ſure, it cannot convert them. The <hi>Minor</hi> of this alſo only needs proving, which is eaſie; for Reprobates and Unrenewed Men, neither have Chriſt, nor the Spirit of Chriſt, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9, 10. <hi>Galat.</hi> 4.6.) and ſo they cannot be Spiritual, but intirely Natural and Carnal, being without Chriſt, and without his Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, No Man can come to Chriſt, except the Father draw him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.44. but he draws not all men whatſoever: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all men whatſoever have not ſufficient Grace, enabling them to go to Chriſt, and ſo to convert and turn to God. The <hi>Major</hi> is Chriſts plain aſſertion in the place cited. The <hi>Minor</hi>
                     <pb n="157" facs="tcp:56523:99"/>is clear from <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.45. where Chriſt poſitively affirms, That every man that hath heard and learned of the Father, comes to him: But all men whatſoever come not to Chriſt, (<hi>John</hi> 5.40. and 10.26. and 12.39. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.2.) Therefore all men whatſoever do not hear and learn of the Father, and ſo are not drawn by him; and ſo the whole Argument is evidently proved.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Converſion eſſentially conſiſts in the Habits, Powers, and Principles of Grace; not in the actual operations of Grace; otherwiſe Believers would loſe, and recover their Converſion, and ſo be in a ſtate of Nature and Grace, as often as they are not, and again are, in the actual exerciſe and operations of Grace; and ſo every Convert would be an Apoſtate fallen from Grace when he ſleeps, or is not actually exerciſing his Grace, which is utterly abſurd, ſo to loſe, and recover continually his union with, and relation to Chriſt, and his right unto Eternal Life: But, whoſoever hath ſufficient Grace, muſt, certainly, have the Powers, Principles, or Habits of Grace: Therefore, whoſoever hath ſufficient Grace, is, certainly, a Convert; and ſo if all men have ſufficient grace, then they are alſo all Converts, which I do not yet believe. The <hi>Major</hi> is proved clearly already. I prove the <hi>Minor, viz.</hi> that whoſoever hath ſufficient Grace, muſt, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, have the Powers, Principles, or Habits of Grace; becauſe, without theſe, there cannot be ſufficient Grace: for, there cannot be ſufficient Grace, where the actions and operations of Grace are impoſſible, as cannot be denied: But where the Powers, Principles, or Habits of Grace are wanting, there, the actions and operations of Grace are impoſſible; ſeeing every action and operation is impoſſible, without the Principles and Powers whereupon it neceſſarily depends, as no man can be ignorant of. Therefore, without the Powers, Principles, or Habits of Grace, there can be no ſufficient Grace.</p>
                  <p>They will, (may be) ſay, that habits are not ſimply neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for producing of Acts, but, only for the more eaſie and ready producing of them. Unto this I reply that, though, that be true in reſpect of natural and acquired habits (as even their acquiring, ſhews that ſame Acts proceeded the habit, <hi>viz.</hi> theſe by which it was firſt acquired) yet it is moſt falſe, in regard of ſupernatural and infuſed habits, as both their nature, and their purchaſe (no ways, but by infuſion) may ſhew that they neceſſarily preceed
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:56523:100" rendition="simple:additions"/>all Acts; yea, and otherwiſe, a Man might live graciouſly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out grace, and grace would be ſimply needleſs, which a ſworn Atheiſt will not dare to ſay.</p>
                  <p>But they object for univerſal ſufficient grace, that, the <hi>Gentiles do the things contained in the Law, Rom.</hi> 2, 14: therefore they had ſufficient grace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> They did theſe things by Nature, (ſayes the Text) not by grace. Secondly, a Man, may do things Naturaly good, and contained in the Law, and yet be void of grace, ſeeing he may do them, but yet not from gracious principles of Faith and Love, nor for gracious ends both which (as alſo the gracious manner) are requiſit to a gracious action, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14, 23. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10, 31.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they object, <hi>that the grace of God that bringeth ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, hath appeared to all Men, Tit.</hi> 2, 11.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> By the grace of god, the Apoſtle there means, the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Doctrine of the Goſpel, (whereunto, teaching, which is aſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it in the following verſe, is moſt proper) and by all Men, is meant Men of all ranks, Stations, Qualities, &amp;c. As the word, <hi>all,</hi> is often taken: for the Goſpel was not then come to every Mans ears in the whole world. This objection <hi>George Keith</hi> makes, in his <hi>Quakeriſm no Popery,</hi> pag. 66.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they object, that <hi>the manifeſtation of the Spirit, is given to every Man to profit withal,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12, 7.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaks only of the members of Chriſts body here, by the Context, not of all Men whatſoever. again, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſide the Context, the meaning is eaſie, <hi>viz.</hi> that to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, the manifeſtation of the Spirit is given, it is given them for profiting; as when <hi>Paul</hi> ſays <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1, 28.) <hi>whom we preach, warning every Man, in all wiſdom,</hi> he does not mean, that they had then got every Man in the World warned, but that whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they warned, they warned them wiſely, and not imprudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; as when I ſay ſuch a Man, ſpeakes to every Man wiſely, I doe not mean that he hath ſpoken to all the World, but whomſoever he ſpeakes to, he does it wiſely and diſcreetly. And juſt ſo, when I ſay, ſuch a Man honoureth every Man, or all Men for advantage.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>George Keith</hi> object (in his <hi>Quakeriſm no Popery,</hi> pag. 66) from <hi>Rom.</hi> 5, 18. That <hi>as by the offence of one judgment come upon all men to condemnation: even ſo by the righteouſneſs
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:56523:100" rendition="simple:additions"/>of one, the free gift came upon all Men unto juſtification of life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> the meaning is plainly, as in the former objection, that as on whomſoever the offence came, it came unto Condemnation, ſo on whomſoever the righteouſneſs came, it came unto juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo he is comparing the force and effects, of the offence of <hi>Adam,</hi> and the force and effects of Chriſt's righteouſneſs and merits together, which is his ſcope in the whole Context, as may eaſily be ſeen, but eſpecially in the 16, <hi>Ver.</hi> And if he were comparing the quantity and latitude, of the objects together, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom the offence, and the righteouſneſs came, making them equal (as the <hi>Quakers</hi> objection intends, then it would prove that all Men were as actually in a State of juſtification by Chriſt, as ever they were in a State of Damnation by <hi>Adam,</hi> which is utterly falſe.</p>
                  <p>From this univerſal grace, the <hi>Quakers</hi> draw their free-will in all Men, even natural and unrenewed Men to convert and turn unto God at their option and choice, as <hi>George Keith</hi> boldly (with holy boldneſs himſelf calls it) affirms in his <hi>Quakeriſm no Popery,</hi> pag. 66, 67, 68, 69.</p>
                  <p>But the Scriptures ſays, (<hi>Jer.</hi> 24, 7. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11, 19, and 36, 26,) that its God that gives us the new heart, which we cannot make our ſelves by the help of univerſal grace, nor does that u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal grace beſtow it (or elſe in the <hi>Quakers</hi> principles, all Men would be converts) nor can we turn to God without it. They declare, that it's God that converts us, and not our ſelves, by our free-will and univerſal grace aſſiſting (<hi>Jer.</hi> 31, 18. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3, 5. and 6, 44. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1 18. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1; 3.) They alſo poſitively teach that men that want a true Spiritual union with Chriſt, by Faith, can doe nothing, <hi>viz.</hi> that's acceptable and Spiritually good (<hi>Joh.</hi> 15, 5.) and all unrenewed men are ſuch.</p>
                  <p>And it's moſt abſurd to ſay, that there is an ability, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will in Reprobates and unrenewed men, by means of a ſufficient grace in them, to convert and turn to god, or forbear at their Devotion and choice; for ſo the efficacy of grace, in the point of Converſion, is made plainly dependent on man's free-will; which that I may prove, we muſt know that the <hi>Quakers</hi> (with their dear Friends the <hi>Jeſuits</hi>) doe ſay, that God beſtowes this his grace upon all men only to make them capable, and able, and their free will to Convert, or not, at their choice, and conſent, or
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:56523:101"/>Diſſent; but that he does not make his grace, ſo Powerful on the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> as Infallibly and peremptorily to through and effect the work, ſo as it cannot but come to paſs; for this he will not doe left he take away the Freedom of their will, whereunto he ſtill leaves them to chuſe, or refuſe; conſent, or diſſent. Now then,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, this univerſal grace, is not effectual of it ſelf, to Convert any man; or elſe, ſeing every man hath it aſwell as another (as the Adverſaries affirm) it would Convert them all; otherwiſe it cannot be called effectual, as not throughing and effecting that work in many. From whom then hath it, to be effectual? not from God; for he only makes men able, and free thereby to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, leaving them to their free-will, to chuſe or refuſe. not from the Devil, I am ſure: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it muſt Infallibly, have its effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy from mans free-will, which, by chuſing and Inclining, applies it that way effectually, which otherwiſe had miſgiven.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this univerſal grace in the buſineſs of Converſion, works at mens Option and Choice; for, if they Incline it concurs, if not, it forbears: Therefore it is therein clearly Subordinate to mans free-will, and determined thereunto by his Promotion; and ſo in effecting that work, plainly depends on him, and his free-will. The conſequence is plain from the Definition of a Predeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining and Predetermined, and a Subordinant and Subordinate cauſe contained in the Antecedent, from whence I infer to the things defined in the conſequence.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>George Keith</hi> denies (<hi>Quakeriſm no Popery,</hi> pag. 67, 68.) that ſo the efficacy of grace ſhall depend upon mans free-will, becauſe, when it hath not its efficacy in order to Converſion in men who ſtop and reſiſt it, yet it hath its efficacy in rendring them unexcuſable, and in being a juſt ground of their Condemnation, which is all that God Intended by it in ſuch Reſiſters: for God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended only that it ſhould convert ſuch as reſiſt it not, and be a ground of juſt Condemnation againſt Reſiſters. But, Firſt, it cannot be ſo ſaid to be effectual to Converſion (concerning which the debate here is) but only that its either Effectually to it, or the other thing mentioned, which alſo every good Advice and Exhortation will be. Here there is no efficacy to Converſion, more then to Non-converſion, ſeeing it can conſiſt with either of them, at the parties option. Secondly, you ſay, it was not intended for their converſion who reſiſt it How do they then reſiſt it, who are
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:56523:101"/>not thereby converted, when they do not croſs its Errand and Intent? I am ſure, if they croſſed its Intent and Errand, they would plainly reſiſt it. And ſo its ſtill reſiſted, be it croſſed, or not. What an ill natur'd grace is this, that nothing can pleaſe. Thirdly, its aſmuch Intended, for the Converſion of them that reſiſt, as of them that reſiſt not; ſeeing its Intended, for the Converſion of any of them that reſiſt not, and of none of them, if they reſiſt (you ſay.) And ſo, if it be not Intended for the Converſion of the one, neither is it of the other, and ſo it cannot concur to any mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, Except it do it without God's Intention and Deſign; and ſo if it Convert any man, its falſe to its Maſter and Author. Ile have nothing to do with this Ill-natur'd, and falſe grace. God ſend me better.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>George Keith,</hi> (in the 68, <hi>pag.</hi> of his foreſaid Book) endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to retort our Arguments here, alledging that, as they ſay, their univerſal grace is reſiſtible in order to Converſion, ſo we ſay that the grace of God may be reſiſted in order to perfection; and ſo we are in the ſame difficulty, as he will.</p>
                  <p>But, <hi>George Keith</hi> is hugely miſtaken (as when not?) for we are not in his danger, or difficulty as yet, ſeeing there is no pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; Firſt, becauſe we never ſaid that we had ſufficient grace here, to perfection (God hath not ſeen it fit ſo to meaſure forth unto us ſo ſoon, that he may exerciſe our Faith, Patience, Humility, Self-Denyal, Repentance, &amp;c. And raiſe our affections to Heaven where we ſhall have enough.) But the Adverſaries do ſay that all men have ſufficient grace to Converſion; and therefore we cannot be ſaid to reſiſt that which we have not, nor plead we have. This quite deſtroyes, the pretended retorſion. Secondly, we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaid that the grace of God, works at our Inclination, Beck, and Choice towards perfection, or not towards it, and ſo that we are the determiners of his grace, in order to growth (as we, ſee from your Principles, ye <hi>Quakers</hi> ſay of that univerſal pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed grace, in order to Converſion) but that God, by his grace al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways determins us. to the growth he deſigns it for, not our free-will, his grace. Thirdly, we may indeed, reſiſt both the means and motions of grace, and not improve grace, as we ſhould and might too; but God makes it ſtill effectual to the growth by him deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and when he pleaſes, not we; which ye <hi>Quakers</hi> deny he does, leſt he take away the Freedom of your will, whereunto he muſt
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:56523:102"/>leave his grace to be turned this way, or that, as ye choice. By all theſe, no Parity there is to be found here for a Retorſion.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Quakers</hi> againſt this Doctrine do object, the many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations that are in Scripture unto our Converſion and turning to God. Whereunto I anſwer, That theſe Exhortations do not ſhew what we can do, but what we ought to do; and that ſo putting us to it, we may know our inability to do, that we may ſee our loſtneſs, and flee to Chriſt. And Secondly, Theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations are given in Scripture, as a means by which God does Effectually, by his Spirits Efficacy joyned, work Converſion in his Elect, who promiſcuouſly live amongſt the reſt of the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. And Thirdly, They are given to make the wicked the more unexcuſable, when they will not Obey, nor receive Grace offered, and turn, that they may be ſaved.</p>
                  <p>Upon this univerſal Grace, and their free-will thereby, they alſo build the Apoſtacy of the Saints, alledging, that they may totally and finally fall away, who have true and real beginnings of Sanctification, as <hi>George Keith</hi> alledges, (in his <hi>Quakeriſm no Popery,</hi> page 73.) but it's all in vain: for, the Scriptures tell us, that God cauſes theſe, to whom he gives a new heart, to walk in his Statutes and keep his Judgments, without departing from him, (<hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26.) and that theſe that are once planted in the Houſe of God, ſhall ſtill bring forth fruit in old age, and ſo ſhall perſevere, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 92.13, 14.) and that whomſoever God effectually calls, he alſo juſtifies and glorifies them, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3.) and that he hath made them Heirs, and joynt Heirs of God with Chriſt, and given them the Spirit, as an earneſt thereof, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15, 17. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22. and 5.5. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.13, 14. <hi>Galat.</hi> 4.6, 7.) and that Believers are kept by the Power of God through Faith unto Salvation: (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5.) and that whoſoever is born of God, doth not commit Sin, (with full conſent, or unto death) for his Seed, which is incorruptible, (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23.) remains in him, ſo that he cannot ſin, <hi>viz.</hi> with full conſent, or unto Death, (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.9.) becauſe he is born of God. I do not here ſtand to Argument from theſe Scriptures, becauſe both they are of themſelves clear, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they have been often handled before, by our Writers againſt <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and <hi>Arminians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, they uſe to object moſt ordinarily, from the many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:56523:102"/>that we have in Scripture to perſeverance, which (they alledge) imports, that true and real Saints may fall totally and finally away. But they miſtake: for theſe Exhortations are given as a means, by which God, by his Spiritual Efficacy joyned, deſigns, and carries on the Saints perſeverance, and to ſhew others their Duty, wherein if they fail, to be their ditty, as was before ſaid.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>George Keith</hi> objects, (<hi>Quakeriſm no Popery,</hi> pag. 74.) Theſe who received the Seed in ſtony ground, (as it is explained, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.5.) who afterwards fell finally away.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Theſe were temporary Believers, never really or truly Regenerated and Sanctified, (as is ſure from the Scriptures we have cited preſently to the contrary) but they had a profeſſion of Converſion, and a temporary Current Flood of Affection, ariſing from ſome Carnal Motives of Pleaſure, Advantage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and thereupon alſo they ſeemed to the Church to be really and truly Converted; albeit it was not ſo, and they were never really Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated, or Sanctified; for, if they had been ſo, they had not fallen finally away, ſeeing (beſide what is above ſaid) the gifts and calling of God are without Repentance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.29.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He objects from <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.19, 20. where it's ſaid, That the <hi>Jews</hi> were broken off from the Covenant, that we <hi>Gentiles</hi> might be graffed in. But this ſays nothing either, ſeeing many profeſſed Members are broken off; but they were never truly and really Sanctified or Regenerated, which are the only Perſons concerning whom the Queſtion is, nor were theſe <hi>Jews</hi> whom the Apoſtle there ſpeaks of, ſo much as profeſſed Members of the Goſpel and Chriſtian Church.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He objects from <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. (ſee the place, for I will not ſtand to repeat the words) where the Apoſtle ſpeaks only of ſuch as had received (though in a great degree) ſome common illuminations of the Spirit, and ſome common operations of his Grace; but not of theſe who were truly Regenerated and truly Sanctified, though they had once eſcaped the external Pollutions of the World, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſays, (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20.) and for all this, I appeal the Scriptures which I have produced to the contrary, which are both plain and unanſwerable. And when he again ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects from the 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.18. I anſwer likewiſe, that the Apoſtle there means of men that Externally, and in the Eyes of the World
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:56523:103"/>were clean eſcaped from them who live in Error; but were not really ſo, or really and truly Sanctified; for, theſe that go away from us, are not of us, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 2.19.) although they may for a time profeſs and ſeem to be of us, and in our Judgment of Charity (when we know no relevant ground againſt it) be ſo conſtrued.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, He objects to us from <hi>Jud.</hi> 4.5, 6. where truly I hardly ſee any Apoſtacy, but that of the Angels that fell from their Primaeve Condition, which will never infer the Apoſtacy of any mean Saint, ſeeing none of theſe is ſo abſolutely at the Devils Devotion. Or, if he means of theſe in the fourth Verſe, who were crept in, and turn'd the Grace of God into wantonneſs, that is only meant of the means of Grace, (which are often called Grace, (<hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11.) and the offers of Grace; not of Grace once really and ſubjectively infuſed, or conferred, which would have perſevered to Salvation; whereas theſe men there ſpoken of, were before of old Ordained to Condemnation, ſays the Text.</p>

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:56523:103"/>perfectly juſtified here-away, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1.) nor can a Remiſſion, or Pardon of Sins, or an Imputation of Righteouſneſs be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, except it be a full Pardon, and a full Imputation.</p>
                  <p>The Queſtion therefore, is only concerning the Saints their Sanctification in this Life, in regard of which, I muſt diſtinguiſh a <hi>Perfection of Parts;</hi> which is, when we have a degree of every Grace, and are renewed in ſome meaſure in every power and faculty of the whole Man, though we be not come to the juſt and due meaſure in any of them; <hi>And a Perfection of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,</hi> which conſiſts in the compleat meaſure of our Conformity, and our exact Correſpondence to the Law of God, in reſpect of all whatſoever it requires.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>George Keiths</hi> Divine Condeſcenſion, or <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, (wherein he abuſes ſome worthy Men) does not conſiſt in Gods remitting, or nullifying of his Law in it's Direction, and Obligation, as our Rule, which cannot be, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 5.18, 19.) but in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine acceptance of the Righteouſneſs of a Redeemer, and Surety, inſtead of our own Perſonal Righteouſneſs of Works.</p>
                  <p>The firſt kind of Perfection I willingly yield to the Saints in this Life, ſeeing every true and real Saint hath ſome meaſure of every Grace, and is in ſome degree renewed in every power and faculty of the whole Man, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.24. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.10.</p>
                  <p>But that any man is Perfect in this Life, in the ſecond ſence of Perfection, (which yet is the moſt proper) ſo as to be altogether ſinleſs, (as <hi>George Keith</hi> would have it, in his <hi>Quakeriſm no Popery,</hi> pag. 37. 38.) I utterly deny; and albeit the Affirmer be ſtill obliged to prove, not I the Denier, yet I prove it. Firſt, Becauſe <hi>David</hi> ſays, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.12.) <hi>Who can underſtand his Errors?</hi> and he prays, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 143.2.) That God would not enter into judgment with him: <hi>for in thy ſight</hi> (ſays he) <hi>no man living ſhall be juſtified, viz.</hi> by his own Righteouſneſs and Goodneſs; and ſo he intreats not to be Examined, or Judged, according to what he was in himſelf, and I ſtill believe, that he was as perfect as any <hi>Quaker,</hi> or <hi>George Keith,</hi> an <hi>Anteſignanus,</hi> or Banner-Bearer amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Solomon,</hi> who was as wiſe as any <hi>Quaker,</hi> ſays, (<hi>Prov.</hi> 20.7.) <hi>Who can ſay, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my ſin?</hi> The <hi>Quakers</hi> anſwer him, (forſooth) that they can ſay it. Let them be doing then, and contradict him,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:56523:104"/>and the holy Spirit too, by whoſe Inſpiration he was ordered, in writing of that: for I cannot hinder them. Their Moon is at the Full.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Apoſtle tells us, (<hi>Galat.</hi> 5.17.) That <hi>the Fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the Fleſh in Believers,</hi> (for he ſpeaks not of others, who are all Fleſh, or wholly Carnal, and have no Spirit, or Renewed part) <hi>ſo, that they cannot</hi> (behold how peremptory the Expreſſion is) <hi>do the things that they would.</hi> Such men are not perfect then, albeit the <hi>Quakers</hi> may (poſſibly) differ from the Apoſtles Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſays moſt peremptorily, (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.8.) That, <hi>if we ſay, we have no Sin, we deceive our ſelves, and the truth is not in us.</hi> The <hi>Quakers</hi> anſwer, That the ſame Apoſtle ſays, (<hi>Chap.</hi> 3.9.) That <hi>whoſoever is born of God doth not commit Sin; for, his Seed remains in him, and he cannot ſin, becauſe he is born of God.</hi> But firſt, This Text cannot be meant of a full and compleat Perfection, ſeeing every Man hath Sin, and he deceives himſelf that thinks otherwiſe, by the former Text; and he that hath any Sin, cannot be compleatly Perfect. Secondly, If this laſt Text were meant of Perfection, it would prove every true Convert, from the very firſt new breath in him, (ſeeing, even then, <hi>he is born of God,</hi> which is the Apoſtles ground, why he cannot commit Sin in the manner that he means) to be compleatly Perfect, and exempted from Sin; which, yet, I think, the <hi>Quakers</hi> themſelves will not ſay. The Apoſtle therefore in the firſt Text, means of Sin dwelling in the beſt of Saints here away, and therefore he expreſſes it by, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, ſignifying, to have ſin; and in the ſecond Text, he means of ſin, not only dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but reigning in us, and made (as it were) a trade of, and acted with full conſent, (which Renewed Men cannot do) and therefore he expreſſes this by, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, ſignifying, to make, and deviſe, or contrive Sin, (as it were) by Trade. <hi>George Keith</hi> anſwers, That though we have Sin in us, yet, it is not our Sin, but our Temptation, (<hi>Quakeriſm no Popery,</hi> pag. 38. 39.) and that this does not infer Actual Sin however. Contrariwiſe, The Apoſtle calls it Sin, and that peremptorily, certifying us, <hi>That we deceive our ſelves, if we ſay we have it not.</hi> How then does <hi>George Keith</hi> call it only a Temptation to Sin? and,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:56523:104"/>Whether ſhall we believe him, or the Apoſtle that calls it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly Sin? Secondly, If it be not our Sin, whoſe Sin (I pray) is it? it's not the Devils, ſeeing not he, <hi>but we have it,</hi> (ſays the Text) and, I am ſure, they will not be ſo impudently Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, as to aſcribe it to God: Therefore, it is certainly ours, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it muſt be ſome bodies, and it will alſo mud and defile our actions.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, The Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> (who was, I believe, more perfect than any <hi>Quaker</hi>) moſt heavily complains, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 7.15. <hi>ver.</hi> to the end) of his Corruption, Imperfection, and Sin dwelling in him againſt his will, his heart, and his ſtrong Inclinations to the contrary; and therefore, certainly, he was not perfect, and I know not who dare pretend beyond him. But <hi>George Keith</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies (<hi>Quakeriſm no Popery,</hi> pag. 39. 40.) That the Apoſtle is not there deſcribing his then-preſent-Condition, but the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of himſelf and others, as they were in the ſtrugling and warfare Eſtate, before the Victory was attained. But Contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, he is deſcribing his then-preſent-Condition; for, he was not then perfect, nor long after it, when he wrote the Epiſtle from <hi>Rome</hi> to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> (compare <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.12. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.11, 13, 15. and 15.22, 23.) which was ſeveral years after his writing of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans;</hi> and, certainly, he had got the Victory over his Corruption then, (I mean in the very time that he points at, whether it were preſent, or paſt) ſeeing it was thrown out of his affection, and he hated it, (<hi>ver.</hi> 15.) and he was come the length of delighting in the Law of God, after the Inward Man, (<hi>ver.</hi> 22.) and with the mind he ſerved the Law of God, (<hi>ver.</hi> 25.) all which import a great Victory, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Enemies were not all utterly deſtroyed and gone, yet their force was broken. And albeit the Law in his Members was ſtill drawing him into, or towards captivity, (which <hi>George Keith</hi> thinks abſurd to ſay of the Apoſtle at that time) yet, this expreſſes only the endeavours of his Natural Corruption, not it's ſucceſs; for his unrenewed part was Carnal, ſold under Sin, and no good thing dwelt in it: and what abſurdity is there here? and when the Apoſtle ſumms all into one Concluſion, (<hi>ver.</hi> 25.) that with the mind then, he himſelf ſerved the Law of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſee not a poſſibility for <hi>George Keiths</hi> Metaſchematiſmus, except he will ſay, that the Apoſtle did not at that time, when he wrote
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:56523:105"/>this Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> with the mind ſerve the Law of God, but that he did it only before, when he was in the ſtrugling and warfare-Eſtate, before he had got the Victory, which will both be falſe enough, and abſurd enough, as I judge.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>There is not a juſt man upon Earth,</hi> (ſays <hi>Solomon, Eccleſ.</hi> 7.20.) <hi>that doth good and ſinneth not: Ergo,</hi> there is no man upon Earth Perfect. <hi>George Keith</hi> anſwers to this, (<hi>Quakeriſm no Popery,</hi> pag. 40.) That the Verb being in the ſecond future, may be turned in the Potential Mood, There is not a juſt man upon Earth, that doth good, and may not Sin.</p>
                  <p>But firſt, The Verb is in the Indicative Mood; and therefore our Tranſlation has the advantage.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Solomon</hi> is explaining ſomething that people might be ignorant of, which was not a bare poſſibility of mens ſinning, (for who could be ignorant of that?) but it muſt be meant of their actual ſinning, and ſhort-coming, and that even in their beſt performances, in regard of the manner.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>No man can ſay he is pure from his Sin,</hi> (Prov. 20.9.) and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was not fully pure from it, when he wrote to the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Philippians,</hi> (<hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23.24. <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.12.) and as long as a man is not pure from his Sin, he is not perfect, nor can his actions (morally conſidered) be perfect either; a Fountain not fully pure, ſends not forth perfect pure water, and ſtill proportionably, the goodneſs and perfection of the Fruit, follows upon the goodneſs and perfection of the Tree, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 7.17.) and that it can no ways exceed. Add alſo theſe three Scriptures, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.46. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 64.6. <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.2.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, I canot but admire, that any man ſhould ſo far loſe all ſence of ſin, and ſhort-coming in his Duty, as to think, that he is come up to the full meaſure required in Gods Law, <hi>to love the Lord his God with all his Heart, Soul, and Mind, and his Neighbour as himſelf.</hi> Surely, there is no man that dare pretend to an exact performance hereof; and therefore, there is no man compleatly perfect, and exactly ſinleſs.</p>
                  <p>But the Adverſaries object, That all the works and gifts of God are perfect, and that therefore our Sanctification, being a work and gift of God, muſt be perfect.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> This objection endeavours to prove, that our Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is perfect in the very firſt moment of our Converſion and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:56523:105"/>Regeneration, ſeeing even then, it is a work and gift of God, as well as afterwards, and this undoes the Argument.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, All Gods works and gifts are perfect, if they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered Abſtractively, and meerly as flowing, and depending from him; (for, Who can impute evil unto him?) Not ſo always, if they be conſidered Concretively, and as inhering and exiſting into us, who are impure, and in whom they are mixed with the remainders of Corruption, as water that is pure, as it comes from the Fountain, may be mudded by running through a miry place; and ſo the Argument proves nothing.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They object, That <hi>David</hi> pleaded often with God upon the account of his Righteouſneſs, praying, that God would judge him according thereunto: Therefore his Righteouſneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooved to be perfect.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ. David</hi> meant of the Righteouſneſs of his Cauſe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with his Enemies Cauſe, who wrongfully Perſecuted him; but not of the inherent Righteouſneſs of his Perſon before God, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.12. and 143.2.) and when ſometimes, in confidence of his Sincerity, he deſires God to judge him, he does not mean of being judged by him according to the ſeverity and ſtrictneſs of the Law, <hi>Secundum juſtitiam diſtrictam,</hi> (which ſincerity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out perfection cannot ſatisfie) as may be underſtood from the Scriptures laſt cited; but he means of being judged according to the lenity and compaſſion of a merciful Father in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They object, That the heart of ſeveral of the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> is in Scripture expreſly ſaid to have been perfect, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 20.30. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.17.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Perfection is there meant of the Perfection of Parts, or ſincerity, (which are both one) not of the Perfection of Degrees; for, that none of theſe were gradually perfect, may be ſeen from 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.7.10. and 32.25, 26. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 38.17. the ſame is to be ſaid of that large Commendation given to good <hi>Joſias;</hi> (2 <hi>King.</hi> 23.25.) for, that he was not gradually perfect, is alſo clear from 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35.22. In this ſence <hi>Job</hi> is alſo called perfect, (<hi>Job.</hi> 1.8.) and yet, he peremptorily denies himſelf to be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually perfect, <hi>Job.</hi> 9.20. and ſometimes again, Perfection is taken in the Scriptures comparatively, for a greater growth in the knowledge of God, and his ways, than others have reached to, (as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.15.) where the Original word, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:56523:106"/>will render Adult or Grown, and ſo it is rendred <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.14. where the whole Context (which I may not ſtand upon) ſhews it to be meant comparatively; and ſo alſo it beſt agrees with the Scope and Context of the particular places themſelves; and where <hi>Paul</hi> claims unto himſelf that comparative Perfection, (<hi>Philip.</hi> 3.15.) he, for all that denies himſelf to have reached an abſolute gradual perfection, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. there.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, They object from 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 17, 9. (<hi>Quakeriſm no Popery,</hi> pag. 39.) where it's ſaid, He is faithful upon our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, to forgive us our Sins, and that the blood of Jeſus Chriſt cleanſeth us from all Sin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> As to juſtification, I yield this cleanſing to be perfect, as to all ſins paſt, and a ſure ground thereby laid for pardon of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Sins, ſeeing the gifts and calling of God are without Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and whom he juſtifies he glorifies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.39. and 11.29. But of ſanctification it muſt be underſtood only Inchoatively, not perfectly; and the Verb, <hi>Cleanſeth,</hi> in the Preſent Tenſe, imports the work not to be ended in this life, but ſtill adoing, (albeit <hi>George Keith</hi> would infer the contrary) for, that which is before clean, needs no more cleanſing.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, They object, That the Apoſtle ſays, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.28.) <hi>That though a Woman Marry, ſhe hath not ſinned:</hi> Therefore, there are ſome actions (at leaſt) free of all ſin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> If this objection proved any thing, it would prove, that Reprobates, and <hi>Pagans,</hi> alſo have perfect works. Secondly, I anſwer, that <hi>Paul</hi> there means of the action of Marriage con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in reſpect of it's nature and kind, and in order to its proper object, as abſtracted from all particular circumſtances which may attend it, which way the action hath no evil in it; otherwiſe it could not be lawful to Marry; (whereas to forbid Marriage, is a Doctrine of Devils, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1, 2, 3.) Nevertheleſs, albeit the action of Marriage ſo conſidered, be not ſinful, yet, ſeeing every particular action is neceſſarily exerciſed in ſeveral Circumſtances wherewith it ought, or ought not to be cloathed, it may eaſily be defiled and become ſinful by the Veſture of evil Circumſtances, (inſtead whereof, it ſhould have been cloathed with good ones) eſpecially adding the impurity, and uncleanneſs of the Agent which exerts it ſelf in every particular action.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, The <hi>Quakers</hi> object, (and hereby they endeavour to
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:56523:106"/>prove the perfection, both of the Saints, and of their good works in this life) The Saints (ſay they) have in this life perfect good works: Therefore, the Saints in this life muſt be perfect. They prove the Conſequence, becauſe perfect Effects crave perfect Cauſes. They prove the Antecedent, becauſe they are acceptable to God; and becauſe if they be not perfect, then they are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: but ſinful they cannot be, ſeeing God commands them, who commands not things ſinful.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Our good works are acceptable to God thorow Chriſt, into whom all believers are by Faith Ingrafted, and thorow whom alone both their perſons, and good works are accepted: but none of aur good works here-away ore in themſelves acceptable to God, ſeeing they are ſtill Imperfect. Again God accepts them as they are good, that is, Sincerely done, not as they are Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and ſo evill; and ſo from their acceptation their perfection follows not. To the Second I Anſwer, that God Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands our good works, not as we perform them, but as we ought to perform; nor yet as they are defective as to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, he does not Command their gradual defect; but he Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them as they are good in reſpect of their Nature and kind. So the objection periſhes.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, they endeavour, to prove that Chriſtians have (at leaſt) ſome perfect Actions in this Life, and for that purpoſe they Inquire of us, if the Apoſtles ſinned in writing the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, this will not prove, the perfection of any Action of any man now living, except they can firſt prove him to have as large a meaſure of grace, and of the Spirit's Influence, and Aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as the Apoſtles had when they wrote the Scriptures, which will be hard enough (I think) for them to get done. Secondly, the writing of the Scriptures, (wherein the Prophets and Apoſtles were but Pen-men; for the Holy Ghoſt dictated all) may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with ſome Degree of imperfection, as the Action is conſidered Morally, and as lyable to the Law of God: (<hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Aſaph</hi> wrote Scriptures when they were not perfect, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51, 10. and 73, 22.) or elſe (beſide the Inſtances given) what will they ſay of an Hypocrites writing over in whole, or in part, the whole Scriptures, and of every Action of Printing, while our Printers print them over? But Thirdly, for full ſatisfaction, I Anſwer
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:56523:107"/>that in that Action, the Apoſtles did not at all ſin upon the matter (which yet is the moſt Formal ſenſe of the objection, which thus propoſed directly imports the matter) ſeeing the matter of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction did perfectly agree, with the Law of God, as alſo the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an unrenewed man may doe. Secondly, there was much good in it compared with all the reſt of the cauſes, (and ſo it was ſincere, and of another nature and kind, then any Action of an unrenewed man is, or can be) ſeeing the principles thereof (love to God and men.) The ends thereof (the glory of God, and good of Souls.) the form and manner wherein, it was done, (in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God) were all, certainly, good. Yet conſidering it as a Moral Action, lyable to God's Law, it was ſurely (for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons given) Defective and Imperfect, as to the exact and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Degree of love to God and men, and reſpect to the glory of God and good of Souls, and Acting in it, in pure obedience to Gods Command, wherewith every perfect Action is to be qualified.</p>
                  <p>They will (may be) ſay, that then, the Scriptures would be in danger to Contract ſome Impurity from the Impurity of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and Action of writing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> That is falſe, as appears from our Inſtances of an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite and Printer and of <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Aſaph,</hi> when they were not pure, or perfect. And if the Doctrine written did neceſſarily Contract any impuritie from the impurity of the writer, by the ſame Reaſon (and with more Reaſon, ſeeing the Tongue is a more Immediat Inſtrument of the Heart then the Hand) the Doctrine Preached ſhould Contract ſome Impurity from the Impurity of the Preacher; which is manifeſtly falſe to the Worlds eye. Chriſt was the external object of the perſecutive Actions of the <hi>Jews,</hi> yet he Contracted no Impurity from thence.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Quakers</hi> urge, ſaying, though we cannot do all we ought to do; yet that which we do, we may do it perfectly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> This reply muſt either be underſtood, of diverſe Actions, ſo that the ſenſe ſhall be; though we cannot do all the good Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons we ought to do, yet that Action, or theſe Actions, which we do, we may do it, or them perfectly, which ſeeing by (Perfectly) they muſt mean the perfection of Degrees (and otherwiſe it would be nothing to their purpoſe of a ſinleſs perfection which they plead) we muſt deny, becauſe of theſe, and many other Scriptures (<hi>Prov.</hi> 20, 9. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7, 20. <hi>Galat.</hi> 5, 17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7, 21.)
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:56523:107"/>or elſe that reply muſt be underſtood, of one and the ſame Action; And ſo the ſenſe is though we cannot do, an Action in that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect degree of goodneſs, that we ought, yet in that degree of goodneſs wherein we do it, we may do it perfectly, where (it being the perfection of degrees, which is here Controverted, and by the Adverſaries pleaded for, and otherwiſe, we ſhould have no debate with them here) their reply involves a ſtrong Contradiction, <hi>viz.</hi> that any Action performed below that degree of goodneſs which it ought to have, ſhould notwithſtanding be performed perfectly in reſpect of the perfection of Degrees, ſeeing ſo it would both want, and yet not want, ſome Degree of goodneſs which it ought to have. For theſe reaſons, I juſtly deny the latter part of their propoſition.</p>

So, muſt not every man come to the truth, and to the Spirit, in their own hearts, if they come to the worſhip Jeſus Chriſt Set up? And are not your Catechiſms, Confeſſion of Faith, and Directories your own works, and your own worſhip which ye have ſet down for People to fall down and do worſhip to, and be Saved by? And have ye not ſet up this ſince the Apoſtles days, and ſince Chriſt ſet up his worſhip?</hi>

                  <head>SECT. 1. <hi>Vindicating us from a Popiſh Salvation and Juſtification, and fixing a Popiſh Juſtification upon the Quakers.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>The great ſcope of this Querie, is to make us ſeem guilty of holding a Popiſh Salvation by works, albeit the whole Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an World knoweth what a lewd Calumny this is, It having been the conſtant Doctrine of ours and all other Proteſtant Churches, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Papiſts, that the good works of the Saints are not the cauſes, or Meritorious procurers of their Salvation, and it is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon Scripture-Teſtimony as clear as the Sun. For eternal Life is none of our merit and due, but is the Free gift of God (<hi>Rom.</hi> 6, 23.) <hi>And by grace, not by works we are Saved</hi> (<hi>Ephe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſ.</hi> 2, 5, 8, 9.) not by works of Righteouſneſs, which we have done, but according to his mercy he Saveth us (<hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5.) And the beſt of our works are in this Life imperfect, (as is proven) and ſo they cannot merit any good, but Contrarily every defect and ſhort coming of our Duty, Merits, Damnation, and the Curſe (<hi>Deut.</hi> 27, 26. <hi>Galat.</hi> 3, 10.) And if our good works could merit, then we might truſt to them, which the Apoſtle dare not do, (<hi>Philip.</hi> 39 Nor is there any proportion betwixt our beſt works, and eternal Life (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8, 18.) And therefore they cannot merit it.</p>
                  <p>The whole Proteſtant Church hath no leſs always abhorred the Doctrine of juſtification by our own Inherent Righteouſneſs and good works, from the ſame clear Evidence of the Scripture (for which ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 3, <hi>Chap.</hi> from <hi>Verſ.</hi> 20. to the end, and the whole <hi>Chap.</hi> following. As alſo <hi>Galat.</hi> 2, 16, 21. and 3, 10 11. and 5, 4. <hi>Philip.</hi> 3, 9.) and ſeeing, that is ſtill imperfect in this life, it can neither be the cauſe, nor Condition, of our juſtification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, in <hi>whoſe ſight no man living ſhall be juſtified</hi> (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 143,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:56523:108"/>2.) <hi>viz.</hi> by any Righteouſneſs inherent or inward in himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs albeit our inherent Righteouſneſs and good works be not neceſſary to Salvation, as Efficient or Meritorious cauſes thereof; yet they are neceſſary indiſpenſably thereunto by neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of preſence, or as pure Antecedents, without which no man is Saved (excepting theſe that Die Immediately after Converſion, and Infants from the Actual performance of good works.) For which ſee <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.10. and 5.20. and 25. from <hi>verſ.</hi> 34. to the end, and <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.9, 10. and 8.13. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10. <hi>Galat.</hi> 5.21. and 6.8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14.</p>
                  <p>And albeit our inherent, or inward Righteouſneſs be neither the Cauſe, nor Condition of our juſtification before God; yet it is ſtill an inſeparable Concomitant of juſtifying Faith. For which ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1, 9, 10. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.17.20. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.3.</p>
                  <p>But what if the <hi>Quakers</hi> be Guilty of a <hi>Popiſh</hi> juſtification? Do not the <hi>Quakers</hi> hold juſtification by a Righteouſneſs wrought within them, and formally inward and inherent in themſelves? in this they joyn hands with the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in one of their moſt Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Errors, which does indeed contradict the very Deſign and Current of the Goſpel (which is to Teach us to ſeek Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs for juſtification in Chriſt, and not in our ſelves) yea, and the very plain Deſign of Chriſts Death. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. and 10.4. <hi>Galat.</hi> 2.16, 21. and 5.4.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Quakers</hi> endeavour to elude this our Charge, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they are far from holding juſtification by their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Righteouſneſs, with the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> but by the alone Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Righteouſneſs of Chriſt. Thus they pretend in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith, pag. 4.21, 22. But the <hi>Quakers</hi> will not ſo Cheat and deceive the Chriſtian world; for firſt (in that 21. pag. Cited, where they purpoſely handle this Queſtion, and pretend as is now ſaid) they deny us to be juſtified by a Righteouſneſs received of us by Faith, calling that but an Act of the Creaturely skill, and an Imputation which is an Act of mans Spirit and forging, and a Fiction and Imagination in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely will and power.</p>
                  <p>Hence then, they deny us to be juſtified by the Righteouſneſs received of us by Faith, and ſo conſequently by the Imputed Righteouſneſs of Chriſt; ſeeing the Righteouſneſs of his Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Sufferings, Imputed to us in Juſtification, is not a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:56523:109"/>Righteouſneſs from the Righteouſneſs of Faith, but is one and the ſame, as is clear from <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.21, 22, 24, 25. and 4.6, 11, 13, 22, 23, 24. and 9.30. and 10.4, 10. <hi>Galat.</hi> 2.16. and 3.8. and 5.5. Secondly, this juſtification held by the <hi>Quakers</hi> muſt either be, by the Righteouſneſs received by Faith, or elſe by the Righteouſneſs of the Law, and its works; for there is no other third ſort of Righteouſneſs known, to compet in this point, but theſe are always ſtated as the only two Members of the Diſtinction (for which ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.28. and 4.2, 3, 4, 5. and 9.30, 31, 32. and 10.3, 5, 6. <hi>Galat.</hi> 3.11, 12.) But the <hi>Quakers</hi> plainly deny the Juſtification held by them to be by the former; yea, they Scoff and Mock at that more, than ever <hi>Papiſt</hi> did, as is evident from their preceeding Language. Therefore they do inevitably hold Juſtification by the latter, wherein they manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly joyn hands with the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> for all their pretexts to cover it.</p>
                  <p>Again (in the fore-Cited 22. page of their Confeſſion) they have theſe words; and becauſe (ſay they) we are againſt the latter (<hi>viz.</hi> Juſtification by a Righteouſneſs received by Faith, whereof they were laſt ſpeaking) we are Clamoured upon, as if we denied the Imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs, when it is only to theſe that are not made Righteous by it, to walk, as he alſo walked. Here they hold Juſtification by a Righteouſneſs Making their walk Righteous, which is the plain inherent Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of our Life and Converſation.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Quâkers</hi> (in that laſt Cited pag. of their Confeſſion) go on and add, that it is not Acts of Righteouſneſs as done by them, nor as inherent in them, as Acts, by which they are accepted of God, and juſtified before him; but they are accepted of God, and juſtified before him by Chriſt the Author and worker of theſe Acts in them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> That is well. I ſee then the <hi>Quakers</hi> hold not themſelves to be juſtified by all Acts done by them, or inherent in them (as when they commit Blaſphemy, may be) and truly this is all they have yeilded, or ſaid for their Vindication: for if they were juſtified by any thing upon the very formal account of its being done by, or inherent in them, then they ſhould be juſtified by every thing done by, or inherent in them: for a <hi>Quatenus ad omne ſequitur univerſaliter.</hi> But why would not the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſay (if they intended to make any Faith of a vindication) that they hold not juſtification by Acts of Righteouſneſs done by, or inherent
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:56523:109"/>in them, as they are Acts of Righteouſneſs, and gracious Acts, and not meerly, as they are Acts done by, or inherent in them? Which ſeeing they inclined not to ſay, eſpecially where they are ſo purpoſely endeavouring to purge themſelves from the ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a <hi>Popiſh</hi> juſtification, we ſee, they do but prevaricat, and throw duſt in the eyes of the Vulgar.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>George Keith</hi> is in this point moſt plain (in his <hi>Quakeriſm no Popery</hi>) and as poſitive as any <hi>Papiſt</hi> I have ſeen. For in the 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 50, 52, 53. pages thereof, he expreſly and poſitively Teaches, that our inward graces and vertues of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Converſion, Faith as a Work, Love, Hope, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are the Righteouſneſs whereby we are juſtified before God, and that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately (page 53.) which was never true of Faith it ſelf, which does not juſtifie immediately by it ſelf, but only Correlatively, by its object which it apprehends and relies upon, <hi>viz.</hi> the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt. And in his Definition of juſtification there (page 47) he gives us no other material Cauſe of juſtification before God, but our meer graces of Repentance and Converſion. And he cunningly pleads moderate Merit (page 46, 47.) but moſt openly and plainly (page 55, 56.) and he quite confounds juſtification and ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, leaving no imaginable Diſtinction betwixt theſe two, making us to be juſtified by inward Righteouſneſs, and ſanctified by the very ſame (pages 46, 47, 50, 53. compared) which in his <hi>Popiſh</hi> Principles, he is (I Confeſs) forced to do.</p>
                  <p>And is not <hi>George Keith</hi> plainly <hi>Popiſh</hi> in this point, who holds juſtification by inherent Righteouſneſs immediately; gives us no other material Cauſe of our Righteouſneſs before God, but that only; pleads moderate Merit in us by it; allows Faith in the buſineſs only as a work with the reſt; and confounds juſtification and ſanctification together? <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelf was never more <hi>Popiſh</hi> than thus, which all know that are acquaint with him upon the Controverſie.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>George Keith</hi> endeavours to ſhift our Charge of a <hi>Popiſh</hi> juſtification, becauſe he (ſeemingly) yields (pag. 44, 46, 47.) that our inward Grace and Righteouſneſs are not the procuring cauſe of our juſtification, by way of ſtrict Merit, and in a way of ſtrict Juſtice, ſtrictly and rigidly conſidered, as when the work is of equal worth and dignity to the Reward, as he explains it, page 55. But I would fain know the other Member of this diſtinction
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:56523:110"/>from the Author. He tells us their inherent grace and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs are not the procuring cauſe of their Juſtification, by way of ſtrict Merit, and ſtrict Juſtice, ſtrictly and rigidly conſidered. How many, <hi>Stricts, Strictlies,</hi> and <hi>Rigidlies</hi> are there here? he has, certainly, been exceedingly concerned, and eagerly careful to get his Minute and imperfect inherent Righteouſneſs, at leaſt, next Neighbour to the ſtricteſt Merit and Juſtice; and it would not fail, nor he be feared for it in any thing, but that; and yet he has been as careful, as he could, to cover his meaning in this, which muſt be the other Member of his diſtinction. We ſee then, that, if Juſtice will not exact the very rigid Rigour of the Law from the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and take the very <hi>ſummum Jus</hi> (which uſes to be called the <hi>ſummum Nefas</hi>) they think to merit their juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by their inherent Righteouſneſs at Gods Tribunal. And this, and what this great Ringleader of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> we ſee, hath ſaid before, ſhews that they hold as <hi>Popiſh</hi> a juſtification, as the <hi>Pope</hi> himſelf, I believe, does.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>George Keith</hi> is yet reſolved to ſhake off this <hi>Popiſh</hi> juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, in the eyes of the world, and to fix it, forſooth, upon us too (in his <hi>Quakeriſm no Popery,</hi> page 48.) firſt, becauſe they differ both from the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and us, in holding the Act of God in juſtification to be really Inward, which the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and we (ſays he) do not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Indeed it is true, that upon our believing, the Goſpel-promiſes pronounces the Sentence, nor have we, nor need we any immediate Dictates to warrand that; but we may ſoon, or late, get a Tranſcript thereof Inwardly for our Formal aſſurance; and ſo we do not differ wholly from this point that <hi>George Keith</hi> would have us differ, as to the Inwardneſs of the Act, or Copy of the Act rather out of theſe Divine Records; but we differ hugely from them as to the Immediateneſs of the Act, I grant; but I never heard that that was called <hi>Popiſh</hi> till now; but that a <hi>Popiſh</hi> juſtification was always reckoned upon inherent Righteouſneſs as the Meritorious, or material Cauſe thereof; although <hi>George Keith</hi> denies that a man can Taſte of Spiritual Food, except he get it, in his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſtick way, immediately (<hi>Quakeriſm no Popery,</hi> page 16.) as if (forſooth) a man could not Taſte Meat conveighed to him in any Veſſel, or Diſh, and this fully anſwers a long Diſcourſe which he there has upon this matter, ſeeing the Promiſes are the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:56523:110"/>Veſſels conveighing to us all our Spiritual Comforts, of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Salvation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, to ſhake it off himſelf, and fix it upon us, he ſays (page 48.) that, in regard of the Object, they Teach that we are the Object thereof, not only as having our ſins Pardoned for Chriſts ſake, but as being Righteous in the ſight of God (<hi>viz.</hi> by inherent Righteouſneſs, whereof he ſtill ſpeaks) through Chriſt dwelling in us. But in this he is ſtill <hi>Popiſh,</hi> not we, in holding himſelf to be the Object of Juſtification, as being, or becauſe he is (for all is one) Antecedently Inherently Righteous, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore juſtified; which we never held, but that we are juſtified by Faith, as laying hold and relying on Chriſts Righteouſneſs; where Faith is not conſidered as a work, or immediately in it ſelf, or as it qualifies its ſubject; But Correlatively, as apprehending and getting hold of the Object (<hi>viz.</hi> Chriſts Righteouſneſs) let <hi>George Keith</hi> think this Diſtinction as nice as he will (as he calls it ſcornfully in his <hi>Quakeriſm no Popery,</hi> page 45, 46.) which was not ſo nice to the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſtill oppoſes juſtification by Faith, and by works, and ſo does not conſider Faith therein as a work but under another Notion and Formality. See (I pray) how he oppoſes them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27, 28. and 4.2, 3, 4, 5. and 9.32. and 10.5, 6. <hi>Galat.</hi> 3.11, 12. Yea, the very Attributes of the Deity admit of a Formal Preciſion upon their divers Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and Connotations; and (I am ſure) the Attributes of God have as ſtrict an Identity, as the Predicates of any Eſſence beſide can have. And when he Quarrels ſuch diſtinctions as not plain for Inſtruction, I muſt anſwer him that, then, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion is certainly plain Doctrine, as he thinks: but <hi>qui bené diſtinguit, bené docet.</hi> But why is <hi>George</hi> himſelf ſo nice (<hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keriſm no Popery,</hi> page 52.) to diſtinguiſh Faith, as Receptive, from it ſelf, as Inward Righteouſneſs; Unto this I will ſay, with reaſon, as he has ſaid (page 8. of his book) without reaſon, to a man of very great worth, <hi>Turpe eſt Doctori (&amp; immediate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirato) cum culpa redarguit ipſum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next thing that comes in this Query (all the petty Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whereof I will reſolve in this Section) is a Conſequence which they draw from the Mill to the Moon. Chriſt (ſay they) ſet up his worſhip above Sixteen Hundred years ſince in Spirit, and in truth; ſo muſt not every man come to the Truth, and to the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:56523:111"/>Spirit in their own hearts, if they come to the Worſhip he ſet up.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> I ſhall not ſtand long in Taxing the Antecedent whereby they ſeem to inſinuate that there was no Spiritual Worſhip and conſequently Worſhippers under the Old-Teſtament, which is moſt evidently falſe; for then theſe had no Faith in God, nor love to, or fear of him; but were all Black Atheiſts, and muſt all be Damned.</p>
                  <p>Chriſts meaning therefore in that place (<hi>viz. Joh.</hi> 4.23.) is not that there was no Spiritual Worſhip in the Church before that time; but that the vail of Ceremonies, wherewith the Spiritual Worſhip was, as it were, covered and hidden under the Old-Teſtament, ſhould be removed and taken away under the New, and the Worſhip rendred more ſimple and more clear, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality thereof more appear, and be expreſſed externally, as it is plainly declared in the event 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.13. with 18. as alſo the Context of the place ſhews, that it is of the removing of that vail of Ceremonies whereof he ſpeaks, under which the Worſhip was tied unto Typical places. But how ſhall it be inferred from that, that the Worſhip under the New-Teſtament ſhall not be vailed with Ceremonies, Types, and ſhadows, as before it was, but ſhall be more ſimple, manifeſt, and clear; that therefore every man under the New-Teſtament muſt come to the Truth, and to the Spirit in his own heart? here is a Conſequence led by the <hi>Quakers,</hi> in a weighty matter of Faith, ſo quite blind, and wild, that the Chimeraes of <hi>Utopia</hi> may ſooner break the Bars of Impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and the Bolts of their neceſſary Impriſonment, then it ſhall ever be eſtabliſhed with one grain weight, or Scruple, of either Scripture, or Reaſon. But of the Light within (which here they aim at) we have ſaid enough already.</p>
                  <p>But, ſay the <hi>Quakers</hi> near the cloſe of this Query, are not your Catechiſms, Confeſſions of Faith, and Directories your own works, and your own Worſhip that ye have ſet down (they ſhould have ſaid, ſet up) for people to fall down and do Worſhip to, and be ſaved by?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Whoſe works ſoever theſe are, I have at the Survey of their Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh Queries ſufficiently in the general vindicated them againſt all the <hi>Quakers</hi> Cavillations.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I have alſo vindicated our Church from the Doctrine of Salvation by works, and I will not repeat.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, does the explaining, and opening up, or clearing of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:56523:111"/>the Principles of Religion, and our Chriſtian Faith, by Catechiſm, Confeſſion, Vive-voice, or otherways, by the very deed done, make men Guilty of holding a Salvation by works? O brave! the Apoſtles that were diligent in theſe things are much Guiltier then, then we are.</p>
                  <p>As for the Worſhipping of theſe, and the Will-worſhip which here they are pleaſed to charge us with, we ſhall meet with theſe in the next Query.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>Upon this Debate I will not ſtand long, it hath been ſo much toſſed already betwixt our Writers and the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> only I ſhall bring two, or three forcible Arguments againſt our being juſtified before God by any Righteouſneſs wrought, or inherent within us, my Aſſertion being,</p>
                  <p>That we are juſtified before God by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt without us, Imputed by God unto us, upon our apprehending and Imbracing of Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs offered to us, by Faith; and not by any Righteouſneſs wrought, or inherent in us. Before we prove that we are not juſtified by any Righteouſneſs wrought, or inherent in us, but by Chriſts without us Imputed to us, we ſhall premiſe this ground, <hi>viz.</hi> that in the Scripture our own Law-righteouſneſs, and the Righteouſneſs of our works are ſtill taken for one and the ſame thing, and ſtated in oppoſition to Chriſts Righteouſneſs received by Faith, in this point of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation (as I have often ſhewed before from theſe following Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>viz. Rom.</hi> 3. <hi>chap.</hi> from <hi>ver.</hi> 20. to the end. and 4.2, 3, 4, 5.6. and 9.30, 31, 32. and 10.3, 5, 6. <hi>Galat.</hi> 2.16, 21. and 3.11, 12. and 5.4. <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.9.) nor can the Righteouſneſs of our works, and our Law-righteouſneſs be diverſe upon any account that is poſſible to be ſhewn by any man, and (I pray) conſider the Scriptures that I have Cited, which I may not ſtand to form in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Arguments, and which are ſo clear that they need not; theſe things premiſed I Argue.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, we are juſtified before God by the Righteouſneſs of Faith, which is the righteouſneſs of Chriſts obedience and ſufferings without us (for he did not obey and die within us) as we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:56523:112"/>proved: <hi>Ergo</hi> we are not juſtified before him by a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs wrought, or inherent within us, ſeeing that which Chriſt wrought and ſuffered in his own Perſon, before we were born, without us was not then, nor is it now over again, by way of reproduction (which if they ſay, is ſtill <hi>Popiſh</hi> enough) wrought within us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We are juſtified before God <hi>freely by his Grace, through the redemption that is in Jeſus, Rom.</hi> 3, 24. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1, 7. <hi>Col.</hi> 1, 14. <hi>Ergo,</hi> we are juſtified by the ſatisfaction of Chriſt without us, not by any righteouſneſs wrought, or inherent within us. The antecedent is the Apoſtles. I prove the conſequence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, firſt, a man cannot be freely juſtified or pronounced righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous by a judge, becauſe he is perſonally in himſelf Inherently righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous; for he is bound in all juſtice to pronounce a man righteous that is ſuch, and it is not done freely or <hi>gratis,</hi> and if he do otherwiſe he does moſt unjuſtly. Secondly, I prove the conſequence, becauſe this redemption whereby we are juſtified is in Jeſus, in whom the righteouſneſs wrought, or inherent in us is not; except the <hi>Quakers</hi> Blaſphemouſly will have every juſtified man to be Jeſus, and that he and we ſhall be the ſubject of one and the ſame thing, and ſo the ſame ſubject, ſeeing one and the ſame thing cannot be ſubjected in two divers ſubjects, eſpecially ſeeing here the redemption of Chriſt is ſubjected in his humane nature, which is in Heaven (and in the divine nature it cannot) and ſo it would in a juſtified man on the earth be ſeparated from it ſelf in Heaven, which is utterly repugnant.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We are not juſtified by faith as it is any part of our inward righteouſneſs, or a work wrought within us, albeit, <hi>George Keith</hi> thinks this diſtinction too nice: <hi>Ergo,</hi> we are not juſtified by any righteouſneſs wrought, or inherent within us, ſeeing faith is one of the beſt parts of that righteouſneſs, and firſt in the order of nature, which could not have been paſt by in the buſineſs. The Antecedent I prove, becauſe, in the point of juſtification, faith, and works are ſtill Stated in a diametral oppoſition (as I ſhewed before, I will not repeat) Which, if faith juſtified as a work, would be an oppoſing of juſtification by works, to a juſtification by works, and would infer that we are juſtified by works, and not by works, which is both Contradiction, and Nonſence.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The righteouſneſs wrought and inherent in our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves is a righteouſneſs of works, or elſe <hi>Adams</hi> could not have been
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:56523:112"/>ſuch, nor do the adverſaries deny it; but <hi>George Keith</hi> mocks at our diſtinction of faith in juſtification as it is not conſidered as a work, but Correlatively, as being too nice, curious, and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Impertinent in handling controverſies of Religion, and a work only delighted in by vain Janglers (<hi>Quakeriſm no Popery,</hi> pag. 45, 46) for which I think him both Impertinent and Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous, in reflecting ſo upon the Spirit of God, who (as is ſhewed) doth thus diſtinguiſh faith in this point: But we are not juſtified before God by the righteouſneſs of works, even our works of grace, proceeding from the Spirit of God in us; for the Apoſtle never grants any Intereſt to any of our works in Juſtification, but ſtill excludes all of them, and whatever affords any matter of glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in our ſelves (<hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27.28. and 4.2.) and uncontrollably, any man that is juſtified by his judge becauſe of his inherent righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs in himſelf, hath ſtill ſome matter of glorying in himſelf, becauſe the inherent righteouſneſs of his own perſon, in juſtice brought him off. And the ſame Apoſtle alſo moſt peremptorily ſays (<hi>Rom.</hi> 4.4. and 11.6.) That if we be juſtified by works, then it cannot be by Grace, and that becauſe of a clear contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; for (ſays he) that which is of works cannot be of Grace; otherwiſe works are no more works, nor Grace any more Grace, but their Natures, on both hands, are quite deſtroyed. We are not then juſtified by any Righteouſneſs wrought, or inherent in our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, we are not juſtified before God by our own Law-righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, as is evident from <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20, 21. and 10.3, 5. <hi>Galat.</hi> 2.21. and 3.11, 12. and 5.4. <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.9. But all the righteouſneſs wrought, or inherent in us, is our own Law-righteouſneſs: therefore we are not juſtified before God by any Righteouſneſs wrought, or inherent in us. The Scriptures Cited clearly prove the <hi>Major.</hi> I prove the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor;</hi> for firſt, its aſmuch our Law-righteouſneſs, as <hi>Adams</hi> could have been if he had ſtood to this day, being as Inward and inherent, and as formally and ſubjectively ours, as his could have been to him; nor could he, without the Grace of God have had his, more than we ours. Secondly, it conſiſts in our doing and working; and I ſhewed before, that the Righteouſneſs of our doings and works, and our Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Law are the ſame thing, and ſo does the Apoſtle (<hi>Rom:</hi> 10.5. <hi>Galat.</hi> 3.12.) when he, after <hi>Moſes,</hi> Deſcribes the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Law, and diſtinguiſhes it thereby from the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Faith, which conſiſts not therein. Thirdly, the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:56523:113"/>wrought, or inherent within a man conforms him to the Law in himſelf (though as long as its imperfect, it cannot juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him before God, but ſtill leaves him under the Curſe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.26.) and, upon the account of its formal and ſubjective union with him, it gives him, and only him, its Intrinſical Denomination, as an Immanent form; albeit efficiently and tranſiently it is wrought by the Spirit of God. Upon all theſe accounts it is a mans Law-righteouſneſs moſt clearly: or elſe no Righteouſneſs could ever have been ſuch that can be imagined.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>George Keith</hi> then muſt not tell us over again (as once he hath in his <hi>Quakeriſm no Popery,</hi> page 53.) that our own Law-righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs is only that which a man worketh in, and by himſelf, without the Grace and Spirit of God: for I have briefly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, that all the Righteouſneſs wrought, or inherent within us is our own Law-righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>George</hi> objects (<hi>Quakeriſm no Popery,</hi> page 43, 44, 45.) that Repentance, Love, and Hope are neceſſary to juſtification; and theſe are all Inward, and are Righteouſneſs: Therefore we are juſtified by an inward Righteouſneſs wrought and inherent within us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> I deny the Conſequence; for firſt, though theſe be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to juſtification by way of Preſence and Exiſtence, and no man wanting them can be juſtified (which is ſure) yet they are not neceſſary thereunto as our immediate Righteouſneſs whereby we muſt be juſtified, or as the Meritorious, or material Cauſe thereof before God, let the Merit be never ſo Moderate. Let <hi>George Keith</hi> trie his hand, if he can prove that they are thus ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, which he has not done as yet, nor ſhall he ever do. Nor ſecondly are they neceſſary even as a Condition thereunto, nor Faith it ſelf as a work, qualitatively, or as a part of our inward Righteouſneſs; but only in its Relative conſideration, as receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, apprehending, and relying upon its object (<hi>viz.</hi> Chriſts Righteouſneſs) as is plainly before proved. And many things are neceſſary in order to a Bargain-making, which are not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition cloſing the Bargain, as here hearing of the Word, convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Guilt. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in Adult perſons are, in an ordinary Method, neceſſary to juſtification, though both of them may be where the Bargain ſhall never be cloſed. And though where theſe Graces mentioned in the Objection truly are, the Bargain is certain, yet
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:56523:113"/>none of theſe Formalizes it, and receives Chriſt with his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, nor have they an aptitude ſo to do; but that is proper to Faith in its Relative conſideration.</p>
                  <p>Its neceſſary unto Marriage to know of a Party, and to hear of ſome offers and terms; yet none of theſe cloſes the Marriage-cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, but that is done by the mutual conſent and acceptance of the Parties.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the <hi>Quakers,</hi> may be, will object that much uſed, and abuſed Text of <hi>James (Jam.</hi> 2.21.) where its ſaid that <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified by works.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Text is not meant of the Pronounciation thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God (for, I am ſure) <hi>Abraham</hi> was a juſtified man, before his reſolution to offer up <hi>Iſaac</hi> (whereof the Text expreſly ſpeaks) yea, before <hi>Iſaac</hi> was born, Comparing <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.10. with <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. chap. But of the Solemn Declaration thereof before the world, by the clear Fruits and Evidences of one in that State, and that it cannot be meant of his juſtification before God, is ſure, ſeeing the Scriptures Cited ſhew very peremptorily that he was a juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man before he offered that work, by which <hi>James</hi> there ſays he was juſtified. And the Apoſtles clear Scope in the place is to hold forth, that juſtifying Faith cannot be alone, but muſt and will be accompanied with other graces, and vertues, and good works, which give Luſtre and Glory thereunto (which there he calls the perfecting of it) and without which it will be found but a dead Faith.</p>
                  <p>And when thirdly it is objected, that men will be judged ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to, or by their words and works (as the Scriptures often ſay) the ſame anſwer is to be given, <hi>viz.</hi> they will be judged according to, or by them Declaratively, as Solemn Witneſſes and Teſtimonies of the State they are in, manifeſting before all the Equity of Gods procedure; not as Cauſes, or Conditions, except in the Damned, whoſe evil works are indeed the Merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Cauſe of their Miſery.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="appendix">
                  <head>An <hi>Appendix</hi> concerning the Merit of our good Works.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>George Keith</hi> (in his <hi>Quakeriſm no Popery,</hi> page 55, 56, 57.) Teaches alſo that the good works of the Saints are Meritorious of the Reward of happineſs, though not in the ſtricteſt ſort of merit,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:56523:114"/>which he calls Condignity, or deſerving a Reward, ſo as the Merit is equal in worth and dignity to the Reward; yet ſo as to obtain (<hi>viz.</hi> Meritoriouſly, for poſitively he pleads for their merit here) from God by promiſe as he out of his Infinite boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath ſeen fit to beſtow, <hi>viz.</hi> unto ſuch a merit; and though he refuſes all Condign merit both here, and likewiſe in the 72 page of the book, as that ſignifies an equality betwixt the Merit and the Reward, yet he ſtill ſticks, though ſubtilly, to a Condig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity below an equality, page 57, and in all his Arguments he ſtill aims to prove a worth and merit in the very works them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. But I muſt Aſſert, that there is no merit in any of our good, or beſt works, in any ſenſe of merit thats proper whatſoever, to obtain from God any good thing, much leſs the Reward of Heaven. I ſhortly prove it. Therefore firſt, the beſt of our works in this life are imperfect (as we have before now proved) and comes far ſhort of that which we owe: <hi>Ergo</hi> they can never merit any good at the hands of God, but, upon the contrary the Curſe and Damnation Eternally, which is due to them who do not exactly in all things keep the Law of God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.26. <hi>Galat.</hi> 3.10.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Eternal Life is the Gift of God, ſays the Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. therefore it is no ways merited by any good work of ours; for that which a man merits is not Gifted to him, but it is his due. <hi>George Keith</hi> anſwers to this, that both the Works and Merits are a free Gift, and the Reward too. But I rejoyn, how can I merit at a mans hand by his free Gift unto me? Can I merit at his hand becauſe he hath obliged me and made me his Debtor? <hi>viz.</hi> I merit from him becauſe I owe him. When I give a Beggar a Farthing then, I become his Debtor, and muſt give him another in payment of my Debt to him, and then we are free; and if I give him a third, becauſe now this is a free Gift again, I over again become his Debtor. Is not that fine Non-ſenſe, and ſtrong, Contradiction?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Apoſtle ſays (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.5.8.) that by Grace we are ſaved, and not by works: Therefore our good works do not merit the Reward of Heaven in any proper ſignification of merit be it never ſo moderate, and remote from ſtrictneſs; eſpecially ſeeing the ſame Apoſtle tells us (<hi>Rom.</hi> 11.6.) that that which is of works cannot be of grace, nor that which is of grace be of works,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:56523:114"/>becauſe, of a clear contradiction, and the deſtroying of both their Natures which he their ſhews. The <hi>Quakers</hi> then (with their dear Friends the <hi>Papiſts</hi>) muſt either confeſs Salvation not to be by any merit of our Works, or elſe they muſt deny it to be by Grace, flat contrary to the Scriptures. <hi>George Keith's</hi> Anſwer, that, as the Reward is of Grace, ſo the Merit is of Grace, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready deſtroyed; for I cannot merit by a free Gift of Grace, ſeeing I can never merit by becoming a Debtor to a man; for then the more I receive from him he ſhould be the more my Debtor, not I his; whereas, in all ſenſe and reaſon, I muſt owe him the more, inſtead of meriting.</p>
                  <p>Now when <hi>George Keith</hi> yields this merit not to be equal in dignity and worth unto the Reward, I cannot but commend his Modeſty; for its very much that the <hi>Quakers</hi> cannot merit above <hi>Adams</hi> merit, if he had ſtood in his Obedience; for nothing that he could have done (all being ſtill due to his great Sovereign) could have merited properly, nor could it ever have been equal to the Reward of happineſs. And the difference betwixt the two Covenants is not, that, under the firſt, good works would have Merit Condignly; not ſo under the Second (for, as to the Firſt, that is falſe.) But, it lies here, that, under the Firſt, good works behooved to be compleatly performed, as the Condition, before we got, or had a right unto the reward; but, in the Second, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, we have right upon our firſt Entering into, and cloſing of the Covenant, by Faith unto the Inheritance, before the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of good works.</p>
                  <p>But, <hi>George Keith</hi> objects there (pag. 56,) that the Saints are ſaid to be worthy of the Kingdom of God, and of walking with Chriſt in white (2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Revel.</hi> 3, 4) which Infers, at leaſt, a ſuitableneſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, their worth is not reckoned in themſelves, but in Chriſt. Secondly, a ſutableneſs doth not Infer, a dignity and merit; A poor man in great need (yea, though no good man) is a ſutable object of an Alms, though he does not merit it from us; he hath no <hi>Jus perſonae</hi> into it.</p>
                  <p>Again he objects, that God rewards our good works; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they muſt have ſome worthineſs in them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> God's rewarding ſo far beyond any worth, that dare be pretended, in our good works, proves that it is not for their
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:56523:115"/>worth, but upon ſome other account, that we obtain the reward, <hi>viz.</hi> upon Chriſts account, in whom, by his free grace, we have obtained Redemption, and Salvation.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he objects that, <hi>a meek and quiet Spirit, is in the ſight of God, of great price.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3, 4.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, our Souls alſo are of great price, in the ſight of God; yet we do not for that merit Heaven. Secondly, doubtleſs God has a great eſteem of vertues, of one of which the Apoſtle here ſpeaks in the abſtract conſideration from vice; but in us they are mixed with Relicks of vice, and imperfect, and ſo cannot merit. Thirdly, though they were in us perfect, yet they could not merit at Gods hands, unto whom all that we can do, ſtill is our bound Duty; this then will not infer moderate merit, till we be perfect in ſuch Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and even then our merit will be very moderate, ſeeing all will ſtill be due, and unequal to the reward. And whereas he there alledges, that this our Doctrine of the imperfection, and not me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riting of our good works, tends to the leſſening of the eſteem of righteouſneſs amongſt men; I muſt tell him, that this happens only amongſt proud men, who will not be Righteous, except they can merit by it, as the <hi>Phariſees</hi> who would not ſubmit to the Righteouſneſs of the Redeemer, but would be Righteous in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, without that whereby they loſt both. And I muſt tell him, it but only keeps us humble, in the eſteem of our own Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that we overvalue not that. And I muſt tell him it makes us Diligent to look after more than our preſent reach is, and not to reſt in our meaſures attained. And, I am ſure, theirs loſes theſe advantages of humility and diligence (which are great and profitable duties) and of forcing men out of themſelves to Chriſt for Refuge and Righteouſneſs, which are the weighty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of Law and Goſpel. Theſe things may declare, which of our principles here is beſt, and according to Truth and Godlineſs. But I make haſt, Studying all the brevity I can, without anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every one of their Calumnies, though loath to omit any of their objections in a Succinct and brief method, which ſtill I Study, being loath to burden the Reader with any needleſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>

                  <head>SECT. III. <hi>An Examination of one Exception more made by the Quakers againſt our Charge of a Popiſh juſtification.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>The <hi>Quakers,</hi> albeit they expreſly and poſitively teach Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, by an inward Righteouſneſs inherent and wrought with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them, (as is now abundantly ſhewed) yet they deny (in their <hi>Confeſſion, pag.</hi> 4.21, 22.) that they hold a <hi>Popiſh</hi> juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but that they hold juſtification by the alone Imputed Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt, and complain, that they are Clamoured upon as if they denyed the Imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs; And ſo (according to this their Doctrine) the Imputed Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, is Inherently and Inwardly wrought in the juſtified. And ſo, they hope to be Vindicated from their <hi>Popiſh</hi> juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by adding thereunto, an uncurable Contradiction in Nature and Reaſon. Which, that I may ſhew, I ſhall premiſe Firſt.</p>
                  <p>That, the Imputed Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, conſiſts in his Death, and Sufferings for us (I do not exclude his active obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, though I mention only theſe, as above all exception) as is moſt manifeſt from theſe Scriptures, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.5, 6, 8, 11, 12. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.28. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24, 25, and 5, 9, 10. and 8, 33, 34. <hi>Galat.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.7. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.26, 28. and 10, 22. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 42.21</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I muſt premiſe, that if the imputed Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Redeemer thus manifeſtly conſiſting in his Death and, Sufferings for us, by which Imputed we are Juſtified, Reconciled, Delivered, from the Curſe, be really inward and formally In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in the Juſtified; then ſo neceſſarily muſt his Death and Paſſion have been; or elſe the ſame very thing, ſhall be formally inward where the very ſelf ſame thing was never formally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſts imputed Righteouſneſs ſhall be formally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the Juſtified where his Death and Paſſion, wherein that Righteouſneſs conſiſts, was never formally inward; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves a ſtrong Contradiction.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I premiſe, that if the Death and Paſſion of Chriſt hath been formally inward in all that have hitherto been juſtified (as is now clearly inferred, by the force of our proceeding Reaſons from this
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:56523:116"/>Diſtracted exception of the <hi>Quakers</hi>) then Chriſt hath formally Died and been Crucified in them all, (I ſpeak not here of Chriſt myſtical, but of Chriſt in his own Perſon, as is plain.) Seeing the Death and Paſſion of Chriſt cannot formally fall out, or hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be, except where Chriſt formally Dies and ſuffers, as is Evident, and the contrary involves a plain Contradiction.</p>
                  <p>Hence from this wild exception of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> this Concluſion moſt manifeſtly follows; <hi>viz. that Chriſt hath Died and been Crucified, in all that have hitherto been Juſtified;</hi> from which Concluſion,</p>
                  <p>I Argue Firſt, (beſide that thus Chriſt behooved to have Died often ſince the World began, contrary to <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.25, 26, 28. and 10, 12, 14.) That if Chriſt hath Died and been Crucified in all that have hitherto been Juſtified, then his Human Body behooved to have been locally preſent in each of theirs, and ſo Penetrated with each of theirs (for the ſame Room contains a man when Juſtified, as before) ſeeing no man can formally and truly Die, or have his Soul ſeparated from his Body, in the place where his Body is not formally preſent, but where it is: But the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent is a ſtrong repugnancy, an utter Contradiction; for ſo the penetration of Bodies is aſſerted, which is utterly repugnant; and let the <hi>Quakers</hi> (with <hi>Papiſts</hi>) conſider, if the whole great Fabrick of the World, may be contained in one ſmall Nut-ſhel; for the penetration of all Bodies, and of the all integral parts thereof, is as eaſie as the penetration of any two of them, ſeeing their quantitative matter and Nature, from which the repugnancy of their penetration ariſes, is all of the ſame kind,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I argue, that if Chriſt hath formally Died und been Crucified in all that have hitherto been Juſtified, then Chriſt, in his manhood, behooved to have been formally inward in them all, ſeeing men cannot Die except where they are, or were antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently immediately preſent, as can never be contradicted: But the conſequent involves here alſo a moſt horrid Contradiction; ſeeing ſo Chriſts manhood ſhall have been often, ſince his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion, multiplyed unto the diverſe and diſtant places of the Earth where the Juſtified lived, being at the ſame time, and to the end of the World Subſtantially and Formally contained alſo in Heaven; (<hi>Act.</hi> 3.21. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.4. and 10, 12 13. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.1.) And if Chriſts Individual manhood can, by any poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:56523:116"/>be ſo multiplyed unto diverſe and diſtant places at once, then ſo may the Individual manhood of any man, ſeeing Chriſts man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is of the ſame eſſential Nature and Kind, with the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of every man (<hi>Acte</hi> 2.30. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14, 16, 17.) And ſo one and the ſame man ſhall be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be multiplyed, ſo as to be at <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> both at once, yea in all places and corners of the Earth at once, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his multiplication to all of them is as poſſible, as to any two of them.</p>
                  <p>But, theſe things are utterly repugnant, and blind <hi>Popiſh</hi> ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for then one and the ſame man, might in the ſame Inſtant of time be both exceedingly warm, and yet extreamly cold; both wounded, and not wounded; dead, and yet not dead; blind, and yet not blind; hang'd, and yet not hang'd. For it would be a ſtrange fire that, warming the man at <hi>London,</hi> would alſo reach him at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where he may be on the Street in a cold Froſt and Snow. Such a fire would burn all by the way, I fear. Would it not be a long Dagger that wounding, or killing him at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> would alſo reach him at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and wound, or kill him there too? And yet it would be a ſtrong Contradiction to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe. It would be ſtrange if he loſt his eyes at <hi>London,</hi> where no body is troubling him, becauſe ſome body hath pluckt them out at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and yet it behooved to be ſo, or elſe he ſhould be blind, and yet not blind both at once, and behooved alſo to have before, more eyes then two, ſeeing he hath loſt two (as is ſuppoſed) and yet he ſees. Would it not be very ſtrange, if the man, being a hanging at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſhould by ſome ſecret and blind Influence of the Hang-man there, be alſo forced to the Gibbet at <hi>London,</hi> where no man is offering him any Violence, nay albeit, all in the City were by force endeavouring his reſcue? for hang and die, he muſt in the one place as well as in the other; or elſe he ſhall be hang'd, and yet not hang'd; dead, and yet not dead both at once.</p>
                  <p>So alſo, if the ſame Individual man could be in many diverſe and diſtant places at once, let him be in <hi>London, York,</hi> and <hi>New-Caſtle</hi> all at once; let him remain ſtill at <hi>York</hi> ſome days; at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> let him take journey, upon ſome occaſion, to <hi>York;</hi> from <hi>New-Caſtle</hi> alſo let him take journey to <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> Now this man is both drawing nearer, and removing further from himſelf at
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:56523:117"/>
                     <hi>York,</hi> and that in reſpect of local nearneſs; and he is both mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and not moving in reſpect of local motion all at once, and he is alſo both diſtant and yet not diſtant from <hi>York</hi> at once, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the way in his journey to <hi>York,</hi> and <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> he behoov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be diſtant there-from, and not preſent therein; and yet this is in one and the ſame reſpect, <hi>viz.</hi> of local diſtance. Let not the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> then tell us of diverſe reſpects here.</p>
                  <p>Are not theſe a number of brave Contradictions Nurſed in the boſom of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> exception Vindicating them (as they hope) from a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Juſtification? nay by this addition of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions they have made, their Juſtification much worſe, in place of bettering it, and have laid the way alſo fairly for the <hi>Popiſh</hi> tranſubſtantiation ſeeing their exception here includes the very Grounds, wherewith the <hi>Papiſts</hi> endeavour (but without ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs) to ſupport that.</p>

                  <hi>Whether or not the Scriptures do not ſay, that</hi> he that believes hathceaſed from his own works as God did from his, and entred into his reſt? <hi>and whether or not your directory, and Church-maid Faith, and Catechiſms, and Confeſſions be not your own works? and ye follow them, and worſhip them, and not ceaſe from them.

                  <p>The <hi>Quakers</hi> are ſtill in the ſame tune; here the ſcope of their query is moſtly to throw calumnies upon the Church of God in <hi>Britain,</hi> and to perſuade the World (if they could) to believe, that ſhe did ſet up her Directory, Confeſſion and Catechiſm, as an
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:56523:117"/>outward Idol for people to worſhip. O impudent ſlanderers! men of ſeared Conſciences! whom did ever our Church bid worſhip theſe? or who ever did it in our Church? But this is no new thing with the <hi>Quakers,</hi> who (it ſeems) have Monopolized the whole trade of accuſing the Brethren, and outed the Devil of a great part of his Imployment. For they never almoſt open their mouth without either Blaſpheming God and his truth, or ſlandering of men. They are certainly extreamly galled at the heart with our Confeſſion, Catechiſm, &amp;c. For though theſe had been the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Subject of three of their queries, and a part of a Fourth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yet here they cannot forget them; and, if truth will not take their part againſt them, they'l out brave the Devil in lying.</p>
                  <q>Flectere ſi nequeant ſuperos, acheronta movebunt</q>
                  <p>In the next place, the Ground whereby the <hi>Quakers</hi> Condemn here our Confeſſion, Catechiſm, &amp;c. is becauſe they are our own works. But by our own works the <hi>Quakers</hi> either mean of evil works, or of good works: if of evil works, they ſhould have proved them to be evil, before they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned them, which I defie them, and their inſpirer both to do. But why do they enveigh here againſt our Faith alſo? they have long ſince rejected Faith, as its taken Correlatively, and as rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to its object which it apprehends and relies upon. And do they now Condemn it abſolutely, as it is a quality and a work? nay then (I am ſure) they have neither Faith, nor Truth. Or is it only our Faith in the Concret, and in <hi>Hypotheſi</hi> which they Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn here? they ſhould have given ſome grounds for that then, or elſe their Sentence is unjuſt.</p>
                  <p>If the <hi>Quakers,</hi> by our own works, mean of good works, then they Condemn our good works. What then would they have us to do? <hi>viz.</hi> evil, or nothing; if evil, the advice is evil; if nothing, then they would have a Chriſtian to be a meer dead Corps, or a <hi>Lots</hi> wife Metamorphoſed into a pillar of Salt, never imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in doing any thing, but continuing as a ſenſles Trunk to be a prodigie on Earth, and a mocking-ſtock to Heaven. Is this the <hi>Quakers</hi> vaunted of perfection, conſiſting in the omiſſion, of all manner of works and doing nothing? This would agree better to a dog after he is dead, then to Chriſtians alive, who if they do
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:56523:118"/>not ſomething, and that good, neglect a duty whereunto they are obliged.</p>
                  <p>The Scripture which they here hint at, (from <hi>Heb.</hi> 4, 10.) does not Condemn our good works, which are every where in Scripture, exhorted to and Commanded. The Apoſtle therefore means there, only of our works, proceeding from our Corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which works are evil, from which he aſſerts that every be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever hath ceaſed, <hi>viz.</hi> Inchoatively, as the Apoſtle in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place Intimats, while he calls it <hi>an entering into reſt;</hi> the work of Sanctification and Holineſs being Begun in us, and we Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the reſt thereof, though it be not Perfected, till we be going hence.</p>
                  <p>But, ſay the <hi>Quakers,</hi> whether or not, in ſo doing, do ye not keep people, and your ſelves in your own works, and from the reſt? But, what kind of reſt, do the <hi>Quakers</hi> mean of here? if they mean the reſt of Sanctification, Holineſs, or Heaven, I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhewed, that our Confeſſions, Catechiſms, &amp;c. Are inferior helps and means, Conducing to ſet us forward to that reſt, they are ſo far from keeping us from it. Or do they mean the reſt of Idleneſs and Sloath? It may be they do; for they will not ſo much as pray to God, Except when they Incline to it by a free motion, and Inſtigation within.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Quakers,</hi> in the Cloſe of their query, require us to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh betwixt Temporal <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> and Spiritual <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> and <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> I have hitherto abundantly vindicated our Church from the Aſperſion of being a Spiritual <hi>Babylon,</hi> wherewith the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> do ordinarily and wickedly traduce her, and it is the ſcope of this Epilogue of their Queries (they muſt end as they began, ſlandering and accuſing the Brethren) and it may be alſo ſeen in their Confeſſion of Faith, <hi>pag.</hi> 122, 124. Upon the other hand, I have charged home, the <hi>Quakers</hi> with their Errors, Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, Contradictions (and ſhall do in a Poſt-ſcript, with their Papiſm and with Irreſiſtible Evidence, have made good every Article of my charge againſt them.</p>
                  <p>Only, in the general, to this part of the Query I Anſwer, that Temporal <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> are underſtood properly of the places ſo called by the Inhabitants, and were a tipe of the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual: but Spiritual <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> are myſtically and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:56523:118"/>underſtood, and are the Anti-tipe of the other. And hitherto the <hi>Quakers</hi> (poſſibly) will conſent. But we will, ſurely, diſcord in the Application: for the <hi>Quakers</hi> make that great <hi>Babylon</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually and myſtically ſo called, ſo much ſpoken of in the Book of <hi>Revelation,</hi> to be only inward, in the hearts of people. See their Confeſſion, <hi>pag.</hi> 114, 115, 121, 122 138, 140. Where they alleadge that great Spiritual <hi>Babylon,</hi> to be within, in the hearts of people, and affirm the great Whore, and myſtery <hi>Babylon</hi> to be our wiſdom, and the Beaſt be our will whereupon our wiſdom ſits</p>
                  <p>I Confeſs, the <hi>Pope</hi> is deeply obliged to the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like) ſome of them, are aſmuch obliged to him; he is not ſo unreaſonable, as to make them work for nothing. The whole <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Church hath hitherto, proclaimed the <hi>Pope,</hi> to be the great <hi>Antichriſt</hi> and <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to be that myſtery <hi>Babylon,</hi> great Whore, and Mother of Harlots. The <hi>Quakers</hi> are ſo tender of his and her credit, as to Contribute their beſt endeavors, by a new Invention, becauſe all other devices have long ſince failed, for Enervating our Churches libel, and for wip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reproach from off them both.</p>
                  <p>But go to; is myſtery-Babylon our wiſdom, and the Beaſt and Antichriſt our will. Let the <hi>Quakers</hi> then Anſwer theſe few fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Arguments.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, albeit all Hereticks are Commonly called <hi>Antichriſts</hi> (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2, 18.) yet the great <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> ſingularly and Eminently ſo called, was not revealed in the time of the Apoſtles, but to be afterwards revealed, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8. But it cannot be ſaid that the Corrupt wills of men were not then revealed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it cannot be underſtood how the Kings who give their power for a ſeaſon to the Beaſt (<hi>Revel.</hi> 17, 12, 13,) and afterwards, deſtroy the Whore (<hi>ver.</hi> 16. there) ſhall deſtroy the carnal wiſdom of all men, ſo that it ſhall be found no more at all, as it is ſaid of that great Whore <hi>Babylon,</hi> after theſe Kings have deſtroyed her. <hi>Revel.</hi> 18, 21.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, ſeeing they will have our wiſdom to be <hi>Babylon</hi> the great Whore, what then are theſe Seven mountains whereupon that Whore ſits? and what are theſe Seven Kings, Five whereof were fallen before the Book of <hi>Revelation</hi> was written, one then was and another was not then come; which are the Seven heads of
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:56523:119"/>that whores <hi>Beaſt;</hi> and what again are theſe Ten Kings, which are the horns of that <hi>Beaſt? Revel,</hi> 17.3, 5, 9, 10, 12. how ſhall theſe things be applyed to the Seat, Heads, and Horns of our wiſdom and will? Such an application will be an excellent Romance, ile warrand.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the great whore <hi>Babylon</hi> hath in her, Harpers, Pipers, Trumpeters, Craftmen, Milſtones, Bridegrooms, Brides, &amp;c. <hi>Revel.</hi> 18, 22, 23. But, are all theſe things, in peoples hearts in their wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom? The <hi>Quakers</hi> would make <hi>Heraclitus</hi> turn a plain <hi>Democritus,</hi> nay, almoſt a dead man to laugh himſelf alive, by their jocund and facetious humor.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, the place where <hi>Babylon</hi> ſtood, <hi>becomes an Habitation of Devils, the hold of every foul Spirit, and a Cage of every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean and hateful Bird,</hi> after her deſtruction, by the ten Kings, <hi>Revel.</hi> 18, 2. But I would think, that after the deſtruction of our carnal and corrupt wiſdom, that the Devil, and all his foul Spirits ſhould get the leſs acceſs unto, and worſe lodging into our hearts where our carnal wiſdom before remained.</p>
                  <p>Hence we ſee, what a wild Romance, the <hi>Quakers</hi> gloſs upon the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and great whore, amounts unto, and upon how Ridiculous a fiction their apology for the <hi>Pope,</hi> and Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is founded; and yet, I think, the great Doctors of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> deſerves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards at their hands: for they have done what, they could (and who can do more?) Albeit the ſucceſs and event, (which who can help?) does not anſwer their deſires.</p>
                  <p>And now, I hope, that boiſterous wind of Arrogance, and ſtorm of pride, wherewith that ſupercilious Inſcription of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> the haughty Harbinger of theſe Queries, did Inſolently ſwell, is a little calm'd; and, I truſt, I have by the evidence, of Irreſtible truth ſo overturned, their Bulwarks and daſhed the force of their Heretical Armado of falſhoods that they ſhall not ſo confidently hereafter Summon the Armies of <hi>Iſrael</hi> with a defiance. But if their courage be ſo undaunted, that no routing, of their Forces can abate it, nor Impoſe ſilence upon them, but they will ſtill be ſmattering, and will yet rally upon us with the new ſupply of a Reply; then I muſt, require them at the Inſtance of all rational Creatures to ſpeak Reaſon and ſenſe; for, (in earneſt, not in jeſt I ſay it) they are often ſo obſcure in their Aenigmatical Riddles, and abſtruſe Expreſſions of myſterious and Cloudy non-ſenſe that they
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:56523:119"/>tranſcend and over-reach the moſt Metaphyſical capacity of all mortals. This demand is ſo exceedingly reaſonable that, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, if any <hi>Quaker,</hi> ſhall as yet have the boldneſs, to Compear in the defence of their heretical Intereſt, it will, without further preſſing, be accepted and granted. Another thing I muſt deſire of the <hi>Quakers, viz.</hi> That, they trouble us not with new contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies (as their manner is, when, they are overpower'd and non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus'd in any one purpoſe, to skip away to another, and from that again to a third, without either yeilding, or ſatisfying) untill they have Firſt, methodically, in form and order, anſwered and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied this Survey of their preſent Queries; and this I expect to ſee at the Greek calends. let the <hi>Quakers</hi> then, who, I have often heard are Threatening a reply, perform theſe Conditions therein, which moſt juſtly I demand; or elſe, I aſſure them, for ought I yet know, I will trouble my ſelf no more with their Confuſe Rapſodies of nauſeous non-ſenſe.</p>

                  <p>Sir, I have read &amp; peruſed your Book, which ye Intitle, <hi>Quakeriſm no Popery,</hi> (albeit the Book it ſelf belies the Title) and I have redargued all your Erronious principles whereupon, you treat therein, together with your <hi>Confeſſion of Faith</hi> ſigned by many of the hands of your Brethren; as alſo, I have Surveyed and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the preceeding Queries, that were ſent unto me, by a Convent of your tribe, though ſigned, but with one of their hands. I come now to the calumnies of Popery, which ye endeavour to throw upon us.</p>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:56523:120"/>
                  <p>And Firſt, I find you intend to fix Popery upon us, becauſe the Authority, which our Miniſters have by Ordination, came through the hands of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. I anſwer you, that your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence is utterly null: for albeit, the authority of our Miniſters, came through their hands, yet the authority was not theirs, but Chriſts; it was not humane, but divine; and therefore, this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not infer Popery upon us, ſeeing that authority, as to its ſubſtance, was not a <hi>Popiſh</hi> invention but a Divine Inſtitution; albeit as to the manner, of conveying there was <hi>Popiſh</hi> Superſtitions and Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions joyned with it, which were ſinful, and behooved to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of, by ſuch of our reformers as had their Ordination at their hands; and therefore, that Ordination is ſtill valid, as to the ſubſtance, albeit as to the manner it was wrong. And if their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination had not held valid, ſubſtantially conſidered, neither could any mans Baptiſm, Baptized in theſe times by <hi>Popiſh</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters; but behooved to have been done over again, as not done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by ſuch as had Authority; but that was neither done, nor ever thought needful to be done by any of our reformers, or any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſince.</p>
                  <p>Nor can this infer (as ye would have it, in your <hi>Quakeriſm no Popery,</hi> pag. 89,) that we therefore, own the <hi>Popes</hi> Authority, ſeeing to own that were to acknowledge his <hi>Papal</hi> Supremacy and Uſurpation, to comply therewith, and adhere thereunto, which we from our hearts abhorr: But all that we in this point aſſert, is, that the <hi>Pope</hi> and his Clergy (albeit exceeding corrupt) had the Authority of Chriſts Church in their hands, which, though by them clogged and corrupted extrinſecally in the conveyance, yet retained its Intrinſecal force, remaining ſtill valid, as to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; as Water running through a mire mudding it does not loſe the Nature of Water ſubſtantially, though extrinſically it is made Impure.</p>
                  <p>Nor can our Miniſters, be therefore juſtly called <hi>Popes</hi> Emiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries (as you baſely there reproach them) ſeeing their Commiſſion was not upon the <hi>Popes</hi> Errand, but Chriſts; nor was the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity they had the <hi>Popes,</hi> but Chriſts. Whereas the <hi>Popes,</hi> or <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſts</hi> Emiſſaries were always underſtood of theſe who by his Authority, as <hi>Pope,</hi> were ſent upon his ſpecial Errands through the World, to its woful experience of much miſchief, deceitful <hi>Plots,</hi> moſt Cruel and Inhumane Maſſacres, and imparallel'd Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:56523:120"/>(even amongſt <hi>Turks,</hi> Heathens and Infidels) contrived and practiſed by them, as the only ſutable Inſtruments of a Scarlet dyed whore Drunk with the Blood of the Saints and Martyrs of Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>But Sir, you ask there how the <hi>Pope</hi> and his Clergy came to have this Authority and power of Ordination in their hands; and you alledge, he muſt have it either as Chriſtian, or as Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, whereupon ye (in vain) build a heap of needleſs deductions, to prove our Miniſtry Antichriſtian, pag. 89, 90, 91, 92. But to cut off your long diſcourſe there, I muſt tell you, he neither had it as Chriſtian (if your reduplication be formal, as it ought, and as it ſurely is in the Second member of the diſtinction) or elſe all Chriſtians would have it. <hi>A quatenus ad omne,</hi> &amp;c. niether had he it as Antichriſtian, or Antichriſt; for ſo he has none of Gods Authority, but the Devils plain Commiſſion; Nor are theſe two terms Contradictory, but contrary, and follows the rules there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſeeing many things, and perſons too, are neither Chriſtian, nor Antichriſtian. But I ſhall ſhew you a Third, <hi>viz.</hi> He has it, and his Clergy alſo, as firſt Ordained a <hi>Presbyter</hi> and Miniſter of the Church, before he, or they, by their Acts and Conſtitutions, can aſcend the Papal chair; and ſo they thus having it, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>de facto</hi> by any Execution of Law taken from them, they can ſurely Communicate the ſame, ſo as to be valid. I ſpeak of them here as before the Reformation, not as they are now to be conſidered, which is another matter, but not in the courſe of my preſent purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>And for that you ſay, that many of the firſt Reformers had no outward Ordination, or call, nor were in Orders, it is moſt falſe; for they had the Peoples Earneſt intreaties (though but of few ſuch Miniſters I read) and alſo the approbation, of other Reformers that were in Orders, which was equivalent to Ordination, though it wanted ſome of the Solemn rights thereof; and theſe times are to be conſidered too, when the reformed Church was but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting out of confuſion and darkneſs. So that this will not juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie your Enthuſiaſtick Immediate calls, which I know, ye here aim at by this.</p>
                  <p>But you ſay, (pag. 92, 93.) that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church did at that time, (<hi>viz.</hi> before the Reformation) Fundamentally err, in worſhiping a piece of Bread, and her other groſſe Idolatries, ſo that
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:56523:121"/>ſhe could not be a true Church. And ſo could not have any Church-authority, for ordaining Goſpel-miniſters.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Idolatry is a corruption in worſhip and practiſe, not an Error in Judgment or principles, and it doth not always unchurch Phyſically and Entitatively (as the ſeveral groſſe Idolatries of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, both in the wilderneſs, and in the Land of <hi>Judea</hi> demonſtrat) though it exceedingly corrupts Morally, and takes away her Moral purity. Secondly, a fundamental Error may either be Formal and Direct, when it is formally and directly held by a Church; and then it altogether unchurches them, as being quite off the foundation. ye <hi>Quakers</hi> look to this who directly deny all perſons in the Godhead. Or a fundamental Error may be Conſequential and Material only when it is not their direct and formal principle; but only by conſequence unſeen and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceived by them (and which if they ſaw followed, being ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ingenuous, they would Renounce that principle) it follows from their formal and direct principle. And though in this caſe a Church is not morally pure or true, yet it doth not Phyſically and Entitatively take away the being of a Church from her: Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation doth conſequentially deſtroy Chriſts humane body, and ſo his humane Nature, and denies his coming in the Fleſh; yet this fundamental error being only Material and Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, not direct and formal, and ſo not formally ſuch, could not unchurch them before the Reformation, when the conſequence, in that darkneſs, was not perceived, nor Intended to be held; or elſe the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church often, the Churches of <hi>Galatia,</hi> and many others ſince, had been quite unchurched (when yet they were not) for their Conſequential fundamental Errors.</p>
                  <p>But Sir, the Caſe is now hugely alter'd, and the Scene changed, after that our Reformers have, by vive Demonſtration, ſhewed the <hi>Papiſts</hi> (their Clergy at leaſt) the unavoidable Conſequence, who yet ſtill pertinaciouſly hold the principle, which it cannot be conceived how they can do it, in ſuch Circumſtances of ſhining Light, without allowing the Conſequence alſo. There is alſo a vaſt difference betwixt the <hi>Papiſt</hi>-Church now, and before the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> when many Errors that were before that, but taught, or held by ſome particular perſons, greater, or ſmaller, but not turn'd into a Law, are now by publick Conſent, and Conſtitution of their Canon, or Church-law, become their
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:56523:121"/>univerſal and Church-profeſſion, as ſhe is ſuch a Church, <hi>viz. Popiſh.</hi> And this makes her Guilty now in her very publick and ſtated Notion of ſuch a Church, and the Errors, if Fundamental (which now I meddle not with, becauſe I need not) quite Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>churches; whereas the other of particular perſons cannot do it; or elſe no Church could be long in ſafety.</p>
                  <p>It may be, ye will retort this in what I ſaid concerning Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quential-Scripture above, <hi>viz.</hi> that if the Terms <hi>Material,</hi> and <hi>Conſequential,</hi> be diminutive, as here is ſaid, then Conſequential-Scripture will not be of equal Authority with that formally and expreſly Taught. But there is no parity of reaſon for this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, ſeeing men do not always ſee or perceive what follows from the Principles they hold; nor frequently would they, if they ſaw it, hold, or own ſuch Principles. But God cannot be Guilty of Ignorance, but ſees moſt perfectly all that follows from every Principle; and therefore every Conſequence of his Word is as much by him intended, and ſo is as much of Divine Authority, as that which is moſt expreſly and formally therein Enunciated. There is no place here then for a Retorſion.</p>
                  <p>Having Diſcuſſed this head, I come to your following Libel of <hi>Popery,</hi> againſt us, charged in your Twelfth Section of that Book of yours often named; Where firſt ye charge us with <hi>Popery,</hi> in Aſſerting the three Perſons in the Godhead, and a Trinity. But in this the Scriptures are as <hi>Popiſh,</hi> from which I have proved the three Perſons in the Deity. And the Concrete alſo of the word, <hi>Trinity,</hi> is in the Scripture (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.7.) and it is the only ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract thereof. But the <hi>Quakers</hi> are herein Blaſphemous, and quite off the Foundation too; for if the Attributes of God, and perſons in the Godhead be not Fundamental, nothing can be ſuch. Your Ordination would, ſurely, be a meer Nullity.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, ye alledge we are <hi>Popiſh</hi> in affirming of Original Sin in Infants, who have not ſinned Actually; and Thirdly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we deny your univerſal Grace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Indeed your Principles in both theſe are <hi>Jeſuitically Popiſh</hi> (and <hi>Jeſuits</hi> are the worſt of <hi>Papiſts,</hi> both in their Erroneous Principles, and Bloody Practices) for ye and they both joyn exactly in theſe againſt the Scripture, as I have before fully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, ye ſay we are <hi>Popiſh,</hi> in affirming that humane
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:56523:122"/>Learning and Natural Parts are more eſſential qualifications of a Miniſter, then the Grace of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Sir I deſcribed a Miniſter for theſe of your Profeſſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and ye needed not have done it over again: for ſtill, I ſee, ye would have an ignorant, nay unnatural Dunce. I have known men but moderately Learn'd be Miniſters with us, becauſe of their Piety, and fit Faculty for exhorting: But a man utterly void of Learning, and Natural Parts too (thats an Idiot, I think) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in an ordinary Method (and we cannot now, upon any ground of Scripture, look for extraordinary Inſpiration to ſupply ſuch wants) be fit to Teach; for how ſhall a man Teach others that which he knows not himſelf? a man of great Gifts, though real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wanting Grace, may be able to Inſtruct and Teach others, as <hi>Judas,</hi> and many others have done, but a man void of Gifts and Knowledge, though he have Grace, cannot do it. And herein we are not <hi>Popiſh,</hi> ſeeing the Scriptures ſhew that ſome without Grace have been Miniſters, and called by Chriſt himſelf to that Office; but requires, that none without Gifts be admitted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.9.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, ye ſay we are <hi>Popiſh,</hi> becauſe our Miniſterial Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is tranſmitted by external Ordination from Age to Age, and that this makes a Miniſter, though he have no Inward call, who is thereby Authorized.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> The firſt was in the Apoſtles time practiſed, <hi>viz.</hi> The tranſmitting of Miniſterial Authority by Ordination (<hi>Act.</hi> 14.23. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. 2 <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5.) and for the ſecond, it gives him Miniſterial Authority, and ſo makes him a Miniſter ſurely; nor is the Church obliged, or capable to know his Inward Call, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which his Miniſterial Acts are ſtill valid. None of theſe are any ways <hi>Popiſh,</hi> I am ſure; not the firſt, for the Scriptures Cited; nor yet the ſecond, for the reaſon given.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly ye alleadge, we are <hi>Popiſh,</hi> in affirming that Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ought to be diſtinguiſht from others by their Black Coats; ſo that it is not Lawful for honeſt Tradeſmen, ſuch as the Apoſtles were, to Preach, who have not paſt their Apprenticeſhip at the Univerſity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> For the Clergy their wearing of Black Coats, I never learnt that our Church made it neceſſary, and another Garb not Gaudy unlawful; but that they accounted it the Graveſt and moſt
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:56523:122"/>ſutable, I acknowledge; and I do not think it <hi>Popiſh</hi> to be Grave. As for the Apoſtles Preaching, who were ſome of them before, Tradeſmen, they were immediately Called and Inſpired, which now adays cannot be look'd for, as is ſhewed in our Survey. Nor is it <hi>Popiſh</hi> to refuſe men the Pulpit who can do no good in it; for they muſt be apt to Teach that get that, by Scripture Command.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, ye alleadge we are <hi>Popiſh</hi> becauſe we ſtudy our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons before we come to the Pulpit, and does not wait till the Spirit come.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> do ye think, Sir, that a Miniſter of the Goſpel should not both by prayer, reading and ſerious meditation prepare himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he come to Preach to the people? And is it <hi>Popiſh</hi> if he do? <hi>viz. Paul</hi> exhorted <hi>Timothy</hi> to be a <hi>Papiſt (1 Tim.</hi> 4.13, 14, 15.) When he enjoyned him to read much, and meditate much, for the increaſe of his gifts, that his profiting might appear to all. But, Sir, what makes your Spirit Study ſo much? for they ſay to me, he will Study ſometimes a whole day almoſt, for the wrabling out of a quarter of an hours non-ſenſe. It may be, he is a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> and I very much fear, it be too true.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, ye alleadge, we are <hi>Popiſh,</hi> becauſe our Miniſters have a modified, or ſet ſtipend for their maintenance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> But, (pray you Sir) was the Law of God, ordaining, the Tenths for the <hi>Tribe</hi> of <hi>Levi Popiſh</hi> too? Its true that Law, as peculiar to that Church, is expired, but the Common equity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is ſtill a binding example and pattern, for the Peoples incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of Miniſters with a ſutable maintenance; and, if ye pleaſe, ye may ſee (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9, <hi>chap.</hi>) How the Apoſtle at large proves that Miniſters have <hi>a jus perſonae,</hi> that is a right in Law and Reaſon, unto a competency to live by, and that decently; for it reflects up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Goſpel and their Maſter to ſee them beggars, and brings contempt upon their Miniſtery. But, Sir, its ſuſpected, ye have more Incouragement under hand, then others have above board. Your Ninth parallel of our <hi>Popiſh</hi> principles alleadged by you where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ye divide parties of the ſame Religion, and ſtate them (as it were) into factions, I do not incline to meddle with; for I would rather be ambitious to heal, or hide, than to enlarge, or widen theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, which are to wide already.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, ye alleadge, we are <hi>Popiſh,</hi> becauſe we affirm that men
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:56523:123"/>ſhould not delay their worſhiping of God, till they be Actually In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced thereunto by the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> I have ſhewed your Atheiſm in this point already at my preface, and how ye hereby overturn almoſt the duty of all men both to God and man; and, I am ſure, we ſhall never be <hi>Papiſts</hi> for oppoſing you in that Doctrine of Hells broatching.</p>
                  <p>Eleventhly, twelfthly, and thirteenthly, ye ſay we are <hi>Popiſh,</hi> in affirming, Baptiſm, with Water, Infants-Baptiſm and the Lords Supper to be Ordinances of the Goſpel of a ſtanding Nature.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> We affirm they are, and have proved above, that they are from the Scripture; and therefore no <hi>Popery</hi> here to be found.</p>
                  <p>Fourteenthly, ye alleadge we are <hi>Popiſh,</hi> becauſe we hold it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for Chriſtians to Swear.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> But in this we are no more <hi>Popiſh,</hi> then the Scriptures are, which ſhew it to be a duty, being duely Circumſtantiated (ſee <hi>Iſai.</hi> 19, 18, and 65, 16. <hi>Jer.</hi> 12, 16.) nor do I think that <hi>Abraham</hi> was <hi>Popiſh</hi> when he ſwore to <hi>Abimelech,</hi> and cauſed his own ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to ſwear to him (<hi>Geneſ.</hi> 21.24. and 24.3.9.) And I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo <hi>Popiſh</hi> (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.18.23.) or was the Angel <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh</hi> that ſwore by him that liveth for ever and ever; (<hi>Revel.</hi> 10.6.) Nay what think ye when God himſelf ſwears? (<hi>Iſai.</hi> 54.9. and 62.8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17.) Will ye impute <hi>Popery</hi> unto God too? But, you will ſay, we are forbidden to ſwear at all, <hi>Matt.</hi> 5.34. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.12.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> We are there forbidden to ſwear by creatures, whereof both places ſpeaks, and enumerats ſeveral of them, and all idle and raſh ſwearing is there alſo forbidden (no doubt) but we are not forbidden there to ſwear Holy oaths, Oaths in judgment when cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thereunto, or Oaths upon neceſſity for vindicating truth, as the Apoſtle <hi>Pauls</hi> was. And that no more is meant in theſe two Texts is both clear in the very places themſelves, and likewiſe from the Scriptures and examples which I have brought for ſwearing, as is explained.</p>
                  <p>Fifteenthly, You alleadge, we are <hi>Popiſh,</hi> becauſe we hold it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for Chriſtians to fight and kill there oppoſits in the quarrel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Truly I do not think any offenſive war lawful, where any Prince, or people Invades another, without juſt cauſe. But when a Prince or his People are unjuſtly abuſed by their evil neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of whom they can have no legal redreſs, becauſe they can get no Court that they will anſwer to on Earth, then, I am ſure,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:56523:123"/>it is lawful, nay neceſſary for him, and his ſubjects to redreſs their abuſes by Arms. There are ſo many Inſtances of this in Scripture, that I will not cite one of them; only I ſhall propoſe a caſe which may, and does often fall out betwixt neighbouring Princes. What if any neighbouring Chriſtian Prince ſhould invade unjuſtly the Iſle of <hi>Britain?</hi> ſhould our King and his ſubjects ſit ſtill, and let him take it, and not reſiſt him? All the World then might call us both fools and cowards. I aſſure you <hi>George,</hi> I would both fight in the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, and kill all I could, till we were once maſters of them (what ever ye would do) and judge it my duty thus to ſerve my King, and ſave my Countrey from ſlavery.</p>
                  <p>Sixteenthly, ye alleadge, we are <hi>Popiſh,</hi> becauſe we ſay, the civil Magiſtrate may puniſh men for their errours in doctrine, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Do you think that theſe are not puniſhable; when a man muſt be hang'd for ſtealing a horſe, what ſhall he deſerve for mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of a Soul by Damnable Hereſies? is not a Soul more worth then a horſe, think ye? Are not falſe Prophets ordained to be even put to death, who lead people away from the worſhip of the true God? (<hi>Deut.</hi> 13.5.) And, I am ſure, ye do not worſhip the true God, ſeeing ye acknowledge no perſon in the Deity; and ſo can not worſhip any of them. <hi>The Magiſtrate bears not the ſword in vain,</hi> but is to be a revenger of wrath upon them that do evil (<hi>Rom.</hi> 13.4.) which ſoul-deſtroyers are highly guilty of (contradict, if ye dare) and therefore he is bound to puniſh them.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Ye alleadge, we are <hi>Popiſh,</hi> in affirming it lawful for men to kneel, bow, and take off their hats to one another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Seeing ye think it unlawful, then we ſee, ye place wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip into it, and count it a duty to keep on your hats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which I muſt think the heighth of Superſtition and Folly, till you produce ſcripture-precept for it, which I can never expect to ſee. When two horſes meet, they will neigh to one another. What! will you not be ſo civil as a horſe, Sir? But I ſhall ſay no more to this here, having in my Preface, in touching the fifth Commandment, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that external reverence (in the general, what ever is the cuſtom of the Country in theſe things, if they hold of Divine worſhip) is thereby enjoyned.</p>
                  <p>For that which ye tell us Eighteenthly, concerning peoples or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, and recreations, I thought it not worthy to be numbred.
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:56523:124"/>For Albeit, I know theſe things are too often abuſed (and I am ſure, we are ſorrier for it, than you are) yet, ſeeing all the gifts of God have a lawful uſe, and theſe ornaments are ſuch, they may be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully uſed, and were uſed when <hi>Popery</hi> was not known. And as for games, though ſome may be unlawful, and others unfit, yet others of them are very lawful, and healthful too. And as for ſporting, and Comedies, I am ſure, ye may ſuffer me to break a jeſt upon you, without thinking me <hi>Popiſh;</hi> and ſchool-boyes, for putting them to diligence, to act an innocent comedy, which only we allow.</p>
                  <p>You ſay, Sir, you could have inſtanced ſeveral other particulars of our <hi>Popiſhneſs.</hi> But none of theſe that ye have inſtanced holds good. And I doubt nothing of your willingneſs, but that, if ye could have found any thing to charge us with of that nature, it would ſoon have been laid to our door, eſpecially ſeeing ye have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled ſo many <hi>Popiſh</hi> principles againſt us, which, we ſee clearly, do not hold good, and ye are therein found a traducing calumniator greatly allied to the Devil, the accuſer of the brethren. I ſay not this for your hurt, Sir, but that you may, conſider what ſtate ye are in and repent, if that be poſſible, after ye have ſo abuſed the Truths of Jeſus, and his inheritance.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, Therefore (for I reſolve to adhere to the order of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries above diſpatched) It is a <hi>Popiſh rule,</hi> and a great one too, <hi>That ignorance is the Mother of Devotion,</hi> and ye (both in thoſe queries, <hi>Quakeriſm no Popery</hi> pag. 98.) are not a jot behind with them in that, where ye condemn all means of knowledge, both humane and divine; and conſequently knowledge it ſelf, ſeeing we cannot reach knowledge without the uſe of the means of knowledge, whereby through Gods bleſſing we may attain unto it; for extraordinary Inſpiration is now ceaſed (as is proved before) nor muſt we tempt God to work extraordinary miracles, and neglect and deſpiſe the ordinary means which he had allowed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> deny the Scriptures to have any authority over us, or in order to us, untill they get it from the Church,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:56523:124"/>whereby they mean the <hi>Pope,</hi> and his Clergy; and do alſo deprive the whole body of the people, or Laity (as they call them) of the uſe of the Scriptures. And do not ye alſo deny the Scriptures to be our rule, at leaſt, our principal rule, and endeavour to cauſe all men reject them, at leaſt, as the principal rule? Witneſs the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Queries, and your <hi>Quakeriſm no Popery.</hi> And is not this one diſh indifferent dreſſings? for both of you aim to bring the Scriptures low, yea to nought, without your approbation; they without their <hi>Pope</hi> and Councils approbation; yea without the approbation of your light and ſentiments within; and ſo both of you agree exactly in ſubjecting the Scripture-authority to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of another rule, which, Inevitably, muſt be as ye appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend. I am ſure, in both theſe articles ye are as like the <hi>Pope,</hi> as any baſtard can be like his father.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Papiſts</hi> and ye agree, in denying Infant Baptiſm, an external Chriſtian Sabbath-day, and Pſalms-ſinging to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of Divine Inſtitution under the Goſpel; they alleadging<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>them to be only traditional; ye, that they are ſuperſtitious will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <p>Seventhly, The <hi>Papiſts</hi> aſſert the Infallibility of their <hi>Pope</hi> and Councils, and make that a ground of defence for their Church-conſtitutions, and whole religion, rejecting all that want the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of ſuch Infallible guides; So, do not you aſſert the Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of your teachers (Albeit often they are rather lunatick) and oppoſe our Confeſſion, directory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon the very account of the fallibility of theſe that formed them, though to no purpoſe, as is ſhewed.</p>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:56523:125"/>
                  <p>Eightly, The Jeſuit <hi>Papiſts</hi> (worſe then any of the reſt) ſtifly deny original ſin, and aſſert univerſal redemption, univerſal light, univerſal grace, free-will in natural unrenewed men unto good, and the Apoſtacy of the Saints (all which I have ſhewed to be contrary to the Scriptures.) and in all theſe the <hi>Quakers</hi> are not a jot behind them, but on the contrary, do exceedingly out-reach them.</p>
                  <p>Fourteenthly, (For there are ſix articles in my laſt charge) the ſame Jeſuit <hi>Papiſts</hi> hold perfection to be attainable in this life; Wherein ye are indeed more poſitive then they, albeit ſtill againſt the Scriptures (as is before proved) which ſhew us, that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Gods way of diſpoſition (for the debate depends not on <hi>potentia abſoluta</hi>) who will have us here to have a continual war with our corruptions (that the victories of his grace may be the more glorious, we the more humble, and dependant on him) Wee ſhall never here be fully perfect, or freed from all corruption. And, Sir, methinks ye ſtrongly ſavour of ſupererogation too, while ye ſay <hi>Quakeriſm no Popery,</hi> Pag. 37.38.) that ye can attain a ſinleſs perfection in this life, and yet grow in more degrees of grace for, Sir, when ye are altogether ſinleſs, and ſo neither God, nor his law can ask any more of you, as not being defective, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conform in a jot (or elſe ye cannot be ſinleſs) ye may ſpare that which ye have more than is required and due, to a needful friend, or throw it into the Roman-Churches grand treaſury of merit, and be Canonized next day for a Saint, for exceeding your duty, and giving that overplus to the Church.</p>
                  <p>Fifteenthly, Ye hold juſtification by your inherent righteouſneſs, and ſalvation by the merit of works as much as any <hi>Papiſt,</hi> nay as the <hi>Pope</hi> himſelf does, as is ſhewed.</p>
                  <p>Sevententhly, (for there are two in the laſt) your brethren have endeavoured what they can in your <hi>Confeſſion of Faith</hi> (as we ſaw before) And ye in your <hi>Quakeriſm no Popery</hi> (Pag. 94) do ſweetly alſo combine, to clear the <hi>Pope</hi> from that reproachful name of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt,</hi> they alleadging that the <hi>Antichriſt</hi> is our will, and the Whore our wiſdom that ſits upon the ſame; ye affirming that <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt,</hi> more ſtrictly taken, is a ſpirit ſitting in mans heart Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which the <hi>Pope</hi> certainly, is not, and ſo according to you, Sir, we cannot, at leaſt Properly, call the <hi>Pope Antichriſt.</hi> Ye are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, Sir.</p>
                  <p>Eighteenthly, Ye hold the <hi>Apocryphal</hi> books, at leaſt many of
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:56523:125"/>them to be of divine Inſpiration, and conſequently of equal autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with the Scriptures; for every doctrine divinely Inſpired is of Infallible divine authority: and Scripture aſſurance, or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity can riſe no higher. And herein, Sir, ye alſo joyn with the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts.</hi> And when ye ask (which is your only argument) by what rule of faith we know, that theſe <hi>Apocryphal</hi> books are not of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine authority, or equal to the Scriptures? ſeeing the Scriptures ſays not whether they are or not. I Anſwer, that though by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Scripture ſentence, or plain poſitive ſaying, this cannot be cleared, yet ſeeing theſe books do all of them want Scripture-ſtile (which by the reſt of the undoubted Scriptures compared we eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee;) and they were not found in the original language of the Old Teſtament; and they are never cited in the New Teſtament; and in many of them there are things frivolous written, yea quite unſutable; and in ſome of them the writer excuſes his failings; and they were never accounted any part of Canonical Scripture in the Old Teſtament-times; and this paſſes without any reproof from Chriſt, or his Apoſtles (though moſt material) when they are repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all the other vices of that Old-Teſtament-Church. We may clearly ſee that theſe <hi>Apocryphal</hi> books are no part of Scripture-Canon, or rule, place them in what degree ye will next; for that I care not, but a part or all of theſe things miſſes none of theſe books.</p>
                  <p>As for what ye object, Sir, of many books wanting that might be uſeful (as ye ſay) in the Scripture-Canon, I muſt tell you (to cut ſhort) that I am not here concerned what books are wanting, that is none of the preſent controverſie; but it is concerning ſome books (<hi>viz.</hi> theſe called <hi>Apocryphal</hi>) which ye will have added to the Canon with the reſt that are known to be Canonical, and which we deny to be Canonical, and requires you, the affirmers, to prove that they are ſuch; and though not obliged, as being the denyers; yet we have proved they are not ſuch. And hereby I cut off, your tedious rapſody of confuſed arguments, whereby ye have waſted more paper in your <hi>Quakeriſm no Popery</hi> (pag. 60.61.62.63.) then all your work was worth.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Quakers</hi> have one grand principle, of following the Dictate within as the principal rule, at leaſt, which it would ſeem, and <hi>George Keith</hi> alſo inſinuates (<hi>Quakeriſm no Popery,</hi> pag. 49.59, 103.) will never reconcile with that other grand principle of <hi>Popery,</hi> to believe as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> believes. But unto this
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:56523:126"/>I Anſwer, that a great number (we ſee) of the direct principles of the <hi>Quakers</hi> are but meer <hi>Popiſh</hi> doctrines disguiſed (nay all of their principles almoſt, except ſome that are much worſe, being more Blaſphemous, then ever a <hi>Papiſt</hi> held) and that, of following the dictate within, is but a reflex principle obliging them the more to follow their direct principles, which (we ſee) are generally <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh.</hi> And ſo when their great doctors teach their diſciples to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their Dictate within, they do in effect, teach them to believe as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does; yet not ſo, as to diſcover their deſign and make every man wiſe of their ſecret; but ſubtilly under a diſguiſe, They are no fools, Albeit, they can <hi>deſipere in loco.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sir, I have vindicated our Church from the Intire frivolous charge of <hi>Popery,</hi> Calumniouſly caſt upon her by you in your <hi>Quakeriſm no Popery;</hi> and upon the other hand, I have libelled againſt your eighteen real <hi>Popiſh</hi> principles, from which ye can make no evaſion, or tergiverſation, they are all ſo clear in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſurvey. And therefore I muſt here tell you, that your <hi>Quakeriſm no Popery</hi> ſhould have been called, <hi>Quakeriſm no Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:</hi> for there is hardly one true word in it all which I do'nt ſay to irritate or exaſperate you, but rather with a deſire from my heart (if it be poſſible) to convince you: for I know you are a Scholar; but (alace! your gifts and parts are ill Imployed againſt the truths, laws, and ordinances of Jeſus, which his dear purchaſe of them, teaches their great value. Be no more a ſtated Enemy to theſe; or elſe dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and terrible ſhall the event be unto you, and all who thus tread upon his truths, and Blaſpheme his Perſon as you do, and tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple under foot alſo his whole Inſtitutions and ordinances.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="postscript">
                  <head>A Second Poſtſcript for Doctor <hi>Everards</hi> Ghoſt.</head>
                  <p>There is one Doctor <hi>Everard</hi> (I wiſh he had been never heard) who hath publiſhed a book which he calls, <hi>Goſpel Treaſury opened up, or the Holieſt of all Un-vailing;</hi> and this Book he hath divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into two parts, In the firſt part whereof (Pag. 150.206.347.) he aſſerts that, after we are regenerated, it is no more we that think, ſee, ſpeak, goe, wiſh, will, rejoyce; but that it is God that does them, and that it muſt be Chriſt the Son of God in us that loves God, fears God, obeys God, and believes in God; and (ſays he) though that may ſeem a Paradox, yet it is a truth; for Indeed and in truth (ſays he) there is nothing fears God, but God;
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:56523:126"/>nothing obeys God, but God; nothing loves God, but God. And again he affirms (Pag. 442.443.444. part ſecond) that the good man is ſo ſwallowed up in God, that wanting ſenſe, will, deſire, he now (as the word requires) covets nothing; but now God in him wills, knows, deſires, reads, writes, preaches, gives, prays, hears, and is all things: for God (ſays he) deſires not our works, but our Sabbath, and that himſelf in us, without hindrance may work, know, praiſe, pray, hear, crown, and reward him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in us. Thus the Doctor teaches, the great ſum of all which is, <hi>That nothing obeys God, but God only.</hi> The <hi>Quakers</hi> ſeem to joyn with the Doctor in this his wild principle, while at the laſt of their Queries here, they ſeem to require our reſting, or not working, and condemn our Confeſſions, Catechiſms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon that very ground becauſe they are our works; and to my ſure experience I do know that this book of Doctor <hi>Everard</hi> hath prediſpoſed ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral perſons, and been their preamble unto <hi>Quaking,</hi> and therefore that this treatiſe may be ſomewhat compleat, I reſolve here to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer this principle of the Doctor, and to confute it, and two, or three more of his poſitions that have ſome alliance with the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the <hi>Quakers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore firſt, (againſt the Doctors foreſaid principle) it is not God that believes in Chriſt crucified, accepts and receives his righteouſneſs for juſtification, that looks for ſalvation through his merits; It is not God that loaths himſelf for ſin, ſorrows for his ſin, confeſſes his ſin, and denies himſelf, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And theſe are all works of obedience commanded of God, and exerciſed in the godly; and therefore the Doctors principle here is moſt falſe. 2ly. Angels and men are either obliged to obey God, or not; if not, then they may doe what they pleaſe, they cannot ſin; and ſo alſo fallen Angels, and reprobate men are all moſt unjuſtly damned for their diſobedience, wherewith they cannot be juſtly charged ſeeing (as is ſuppoſed) they are not obliged to obey. If then they be obliged to obey God, then the holy Angels that ſtood, obeys God, or not; if they do, then ſomething obeys God, that is not God (againſt the Doctors principle) ſeeing Angels are not God, I am ſure; if not, then the holy Angels that ſtood are diſobedient to God, ſeeing they are obliged to obey God, and yet does it not; and that is to ſay, the Angels that ſtood are fallen Angels. 3ly. If nothing obeys God, but God, then never any of all the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:56523:127"/>creatures obeyed God to this day, ſeeing none of them is God; and all the creatures are equally guilty, or not guilty of diſobedience to God, ſeeing not one of them ever obeyed him. But theſe things are abſurd Romances. Fourthly, whatever obeys God muſt be commanded to obey him, ſeeing all obedience is to ſome command and Law: But God is not commanded to obey, ſeeing all the commandments are directed to creatures, and God is not under the Law he hath given to them, nor hath he any ſuperior ſoveraign; and though Chriſt was under the Law as man, yet he was never under it as God, or elſe ſo ſhould the Father and Spirit alſo, ſeeing they are all one and the ſame God, though they be diſtinct perſons. Therefore God cannot be ſaid to obey God in any proper ſpeech, and the Doctor (we ſee by his expreſſions above rehearſed) means properly. Laſtly, the Doctor here contradicts himſelf; for if God requires our Sabbath, and not working (as he affirms) and the regenerate and good man does ſo lay aſide all works, as he no more thinks, ſees, ſpeaks, goes, wiſhes, wills, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (as he affirmeth too) then the good man obeys God, In doing that which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of him; and yet the Doctor denies that any thing obeys God, but God himſelf.</p>
                  <p>But the Doctor (may be) would object, that the good works of the Saints are in the Scripture aſcribed to God, and ſaid to be done by his power, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.19. <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.6. and 2.13. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.11.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> God is indeed a very ſpecial Title the principal efficient cauſe of all our good works, and the Scriptures aſcribe that unto him; But no Scripture ſaith that in our works of obedience only God obeyeth himſelf in us; for the reaſons given that could not be. Nor can it be ſaid that it is God that in us wiſhes, wills, prays, believes, deſires, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Seeing theſe actions are not Immanent in God, but are meerly tranſient as to him; and its Impoſſible for any perſon to will, wiſh, deſire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by any act not Immanent in it ſelf, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s any man knows. But theſe good works and actions, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to we are quickened and determined by God and his grace and Spirit, are Formally ſubjected in us, and Immanent; and ſo being Intrinſecally united and Informing us, cannot but give us their Intrinſecal and formal denomination for an act of love being Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent, or united to my will, or affections, cannot but denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate me as loving ſome object, and it cannot ſo denominate any other perſon, as is manifeſt: Though God therefore workes in us
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:56523:127"/>the acts of obedience, faith, repentance; yet it is not God that obeys, believes, repents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Quakers</hi> afford us another objection from <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20, where <hi>Paul</hi> denies himſelf to live (<hi>viz.</hi> Spiritually) but that Chriſt lived in him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ. Paul</hi> does not there deny himſelf to live Spiritually, or vitally to exerce the operations of a Spiritual life; or elſe, if that were, Then <hi>Paul</hi> was then Spiritually as dead a man, as before he was converted, which is moſt falſe, and in the very next words he declares himſelf to live, <hi>viz.</hi> Spiritually. When therefore he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies himſelf to live Spiritually, but Chriſt in him, he plainly means of the fountain and ſource, or ſtock and ſupply of his Spiritual life, <hi>viz.</hi> That that was not in himſelf, or in nature, but in Chriſt the redeemer, and ſo the objection proves not their point.</p>
                  <p>The Doctor teaches alſo in that ſame book (Pag. 16.17.299.361. part firſt, And Pag. 27.29.259.264.265. part ſecond) That take but off all accidents from every creature, and that which remains is Chriſt and God; as if we take away all height and depth, greatneſs and littleneſs, weight and meaſure, heat and cold, mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and form: for (ſays he) theſe are all accidents; and then that which is left is Chriſt, is God: God is the ſubſtance of all things, and all the creatures are but meer accidents, and they are not only Gods workmanſhip, as moſt men teach and believe, but alſo God is their very ſubſtance and Being, he is their very Eſſence and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Thus he.</p>
                  <p>But if theſe things were ſo, God would be the moſt paſſive Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all the world, for ſo he ſhould be the paſſive ſubject where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into all creatures ſhould inhere as meer accidents, and he ſhould be the paſſive and changed ſubject in all their mutations, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations; This would make a very changeable God, more changeable then the Moon, or Wind. 2ly. If God be the very, Being and Eſſence of every creature, then every creature is Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially God Almighty, Infinite, Eternal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for that whoſe Being and Eſſence is God, muſt, in reſpect of its Eſſence, or Eſſentially, be God; or elſe, in reſpect of its Eſſence, it will be both God, and not God, which is a Contradiction. 3ly. If God be the Being and Eſſence of every creature, then the Being and Eſſence of every creature is an uncreated Being, ſeeing God is ſuch; and ſo every creature as to its Eſſence, or Eſſentially is not a creature, that is to
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:56523:128"/>ſay, it is Eſſentially not it ſelf. 4ly. Every evil action is a creature, if then God be the being of every creature, then he is the being of every evil action too; and ſo the ſin inhering into every evil action ſhall inhere into God <hi>(abſit Blaſphemia)</hi> who is the being of the action. Laſtly, If all creatures be but meer accidents, and if God be the very Eſſence and Being of every creature, then God ſhall alſo be an accident meerly, he being the very eſſence and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe created accidents as the Doctor will. Blaſphemous, Abſurd, and Repugnant.</p>
                  <p>The Doctor alſo teaches (pag. 83.84.343. part firſt) that if we ſpeak of God Abſtractedly from all creatures; ſo the Father, Son, and Spirit are all one. But if we come to ſpeak of any thing created, then we divide the Godhead into Perſons, and there is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly Father, Son, and Spirit. When God puts forth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the creating of any creature, here now the Word is ſpoken and came forth from the boſom of his Father; before there was any creature made, there was neither Father, Son, nor Spirit in the Godhead as divided: for the Trinity is expreſſed only in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to creatures. Thus he.</p>
                  <p>But by the Oneneſs, or Unity of the Father, Son, and Spirit, as God is ſpoken of Abſtractedly from Creatures, the Doctor either means of the Oneneſs of their Eſſence and Godhead; and thus they are ſtill one, what ever way we ſpeak of them, ſeeing they are ſtill but one God; or elſe he thereby means of the Unity and Oneneſs of their perſons, and this way (which is the way he doth mean, which appears by his oppoſing the diſtinction of their perſons in the ſecond member of his <hi>Antitheſis</hi> to the unity mentioned in the firſt) the Doctor teaches meer blaſphemy, in denying that there was any diſtinction of perſons in the Godhead, before God made any creature, and except in relation to creatures: for ſo, if God had never made any creature (which might eaſily have been, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he did not create by neceſſity, or impulſion) there ſhould never-have been three perſons in the Godhead, nay nor any perſon; for before God made any creature there was neither Father, Son, nor Spirit in the Godhead, and the Trinity is expreſſed only in relation to creatures, ſays the Doctor. So alſo the three diſtinct perſons in the Godhead muſt be meerly temporary created within time, if there was no diſtinct perſon in the ſame before the creatures were made. Yea ſo the perſons in the Godhead ſhall be debitors to the
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:56523:128"/>creatures for their Subſiſtences and Perſons, without whom (if we will believe the Doctor) they would never have been. Its all Blaſphemous.</p>
                  <p>Again the Doctor teaches (pag. 284.285. part firſt) that throughout the Old Teſtament from the beginning of <hi>Geneſis</hi> to the laſt of the Prophets there runs an Allegory; and (pag. 86. part ſecond) all the Scriptures (ſays he) are Figurative.</p>
                  <p>But in the Old Teſtament it is ſaid, That there is a God, that we ought to worſhip him, that God created man, That man fell and ſinned, That we ought to repent and believe, that God will be merciful to returning penitent ſinners, that he is a bleſſed man whoſe ſins are forgiven. Are theſe, and many the like expreſſions to be Allegorically underſtood? If the Doctor denyed the things aſſerted by theſe expreſſions, and we, to prove the affirmatives thereof againſt him, urged theſe Scripture-ſayings, would he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh with an Allegorically true, Properly falſe? If that diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction were (valid or relevant, then all were gone. And are the whole Scriptures Figurative? Then (beſide what is juſt now ſaid) That Chriſt was born, ſuffered, ſatisfied Juſtice, is riſen again, Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended; That there is a life to come, a Heaven, a Hell, a day of General judgment, that believers ſhall be ſaved, and the reſt damned; theſe I ſay, ſhall be all Figurative ſayings, and to be underſtood Figuratively. And what can be ſaid worſe? for ſo the whole foundations are deſtroyed, if theſe ſayings be Improperly meant.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, (for I will ſtand no longer) that Allegoricall Doctor teaches alſo (pag. 289.294.318.320. 322.323.334.342.347.348. part firſt) That the whole Scriptures have two mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, one whereof he calls Outward, Grammatical, and Literal; The other Inward, Hidden, and Spiritual. Where, if he had ſaid, that one and the ſame meaning of the Scripture may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood with two ſorts of Evidences; one of them External, Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and Grammatical, only; The other Internal, Supernatural, and Spiritual, he had not aberred from the truth. Or if he had ſaid, that there may be ſometimes in one text two meanings, the one ſubordinate to, and typified by the other (which yet is not Properly two meanings but one and the ſame compounded meaning, or meaning compounded) he had likewiſe ſaid truth. But ſo he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſays, nor can be meaned: for in the places cited he often
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:56523:129"/>affirms, that the Outward and Literal meaning of the Scripture is but Excrements good for nothing, can give no nouriſhment, is not only dead, but killing and deſtructive; yea in ſome of theſe places he denies the literal ſenſe to be Gods mind, and affirms it to be but humane; Nay, he flatly alſo denies the Scriptures to be the Word of God; or that ever any man did as yet ſee, hear, or read the truth. The other ſenſe of the Scriptures he calls ſaving, and an excellent mean of life to us.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things declare that the Doctor means of two Co-ordinate and Inconnexed meanings, and not of Subordinate meanings, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe meanings deviſed by him have no Reſpect, Connexion, or Relation with one another, ſeeing the one is but dead Deſtructive Excrements, and the other is Saving and nouriſhing. But it is not ſo with cauſes Subordinate, which joyntly concur to produce the effect, each in their own ſphere and order, as is known.</p>
                  <p>Now to affix two Co-ordinat Inconnexed meanings upon the Scriptures is to make the true meaning thereof utterly uncertain; and to make them a clear Fraud and a Cheat put upon the World to deceive with their uncertain and Ambiguous ſenſes, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently their Author to be an Impoſtor and deceiver <hi>(Abſit Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemia)</hi> with his Doubtful and two-fac'd meanings, and his vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and <hi>Proteus</hi>-like Intended ſenſes, for they can have no more meanings, then their Author intended therein, ſeeing a meaning affix'd on the Scriptures which there Author never intended therein, is not the meaning of the Scriptures, or elſe every wreſted meaning would be their meaning.</p>
                  <p>But Secondly, more particularly againſt the Doctor. Is the lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſenſe of the Scriptures, that teach us very plainly Chriſts Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, Death, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, and the uſe and ends thereof, good for nothing, but a <hi>non</hi>-nouriſhing and deſtroying Excrement? He ſeems indeed to ſay ſo (pag. 52. part firſt) where he affirms that we muſt firſt wave the knowledge of the Hiſtory of Chriſt Externally, before we come to the knowledge of the true Chriſt (hereby he Inſinuats that the External Chriſt is no true Chriſt) that is able to ſave our Souls, But if theſe things aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted by the Doctor be true, Then its no matter, or harm to us, Albeit the letter and Hiſtory of the knowledge of Chriſt were all falſe, ſeeing that is good for nothing, can give no nouriſhment (as he will) and muſt be waved before we come to know the true
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:56523:129"/>and ſaving Chriſt. What can it matter to us then though it were all falſe? ſeeing it can do us no good, is but <hi>non</hi>-nouriſhing and deſtructive Excrements; nay, it hinders us to know the true and ſaving Chriſt; for we cannot know him (as the Doctor alleadges) until it be firſt waved; and ſo its an oppoſit enemy to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If it be true that the literal ſenſe of the Scriptures is not Gods mind (as the Doctor affirms) then we may Counter-act the whole Scriptures in their literal ſenſe, and yet be guiltles, ſeeing, though we do ſo, yet we do nothing againſt the mind and meaning of God in his Word, according to the Doctors doctrine, and then we may commit Idolatry, Adultery, and what not?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly. If the Literal ſenſe of the Scriptures be not Gods meaning, how comes the Doctor to call it Scripture-ſenſe at all, or Scripture-meaning? The Doctor herein manifeſtly contradicts himſelf, ſeeing the Scripture can never have any ſenſe, or mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, beſide the mind and meaning of its Author therein by him intended, as is both clear in it ſelf, and juſt now I proved.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, For his denying the Scriptures to be the Word of God I ſhall oppoſe unto this the Survey of the <hi>Quakers</hi> Third Query, above where I have diſcuſſed that queſtion. But when he denies that ever any man as yet heard, or read the truth, he ſpeaks a little too Tranſcendentally: for if he means of the truth of Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, or Enunciation (which is only to the purpoſe; for we are not concerned with the Metaphyſical Incomplex truth of Being, but with the Complex truth of Oration here) then he either takes truth in the Abſtract form; and ſo never man henceforth ſhall hear, or read it, more then heretofore, ſeeing in the Abſtract form it is not a thing Legible, or Audible; or elſe he takes truth Concretive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as it denominats ſome particular Enunciation, or Enuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions true, ſo that the means that never man as yet heard, or read a true ſaying, or Enunciation to this day; and then he denies that himſelf ever ſpake, or wrote a true word to any mans hearing, or reading, and cuts his own Throat, and I cannot help it; But (which is much worſe) ſo he denies the Scriptures (which many man hath read and heard) to be true. Its a very ſtrange and a ſad buſineſs too, if we never heard a word of truth.</p>
                  <p>But the Doctor (I know) will ſay, that only Chriſt is the truth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Chriſt cannot be the Formal truth of any Enunciation, or
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:56523:130"/>Oration, which is nothing but a meer relation of Conformity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt it and its Object; but Chriſt is called the truth, becauſe he is the Author and Revealer, the Object and End of the Divine truth; for he makes it known, it treats of him as the main Subject, and it leads unto him.</p>
                  <p>Albeit, the Doctor makes many wranglings to clear himſelf of being thought a contemner and vilifier of the Literal ſenſe of Scripture; yet all comes to this at the laſt and moſt (which he never parts with) that the literal ſenſe of the Scripture can do no good; but will kill and deſtroy us, except we reach another ſenſe beyond that, and hidden under it, having no connexion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, or relation thereunto, The abſurdity whereof I have very briefly ſhewed. And beſide, we ſee, he refuſes to own the literal ſenſe as Divine but as a thing meerly Humane, denying it to be the mind of God. And ſo no Apology can bring him fairly, off.</p>
                  <p>But the Doctor objects (pag. 52.318. part firſt) that the Literal ſenſe of the Scripture is not ſaving, nor the mind of God, ſeeing the Devil, and natural men can reach that.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> But the Doctor ſuppoſes here a manifeſt falſhood, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Scriptures have one ſenſe reached by the Devil, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural men; and another which they know nothing of, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reach, which, I have ſhewed to be moſt abſurd, the Devil, and ſome men unrenewed know as many ſenſes of Scripture, as the Doctor does. But the difference betwixt a Natural and Spiritual mans knowledge of the Scripture is not, that the one of them knowes a ſenſe of the Scripture more than the other, and which the other cannot reach; but that the one knows the ſame ſenſe of Scripture with an Internal, Spiritual, Supernatural, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving evidence; which the other knows only with an Hiſtorical, Grammatical, External, and Common evidence; and ſo there are very diverſe kinds of evidences in their acts of knowledge, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from Eſſentially diverſe principles of light and Eyes to ſee with; But the Object known is the ſame.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I have therefore here Inſerted, and briefly confuted theſe principles of the Doctor, which indeed are a conſiderable part (though not all)
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:56523:130"/>of the ſubſtance of that his foreſaid book, becauſe the</hi> Quakers <hi>know (and I in ſure experience too, by the neceſſary and Inevitable, though Involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary converſe I have had with them) who are deeply concerned with the ſame principles; and (as I hinted before) I never almoſt knew any (and I have known too many) that once became the Diſciples and Proſelyts of that book, but in end they became profeſſed</hi> Quakers; <hi>and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I judged it very convenient here (though ſhortly) to give an Antidote againſt it.</hi>
